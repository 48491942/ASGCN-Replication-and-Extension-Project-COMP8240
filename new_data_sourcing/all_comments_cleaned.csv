"On a slight tangent, there are shops selling ""second hand USA clothes"" in my country, and just from one trip to local market, I have seen so many second hand T-shirts that are clearly from the US. Some of them have, let's say, questionable designs. 

To be fair, though, they are still better than, say, being thrown away in the landfill or ultrafast-produced fast fashion stuffs, I suppose.","on a slight tangent, there are shops selling ""second hand usa clothes"" in my country, and just from one trip to local market, i have seen so many second hand t-shirts that are clearly from the us. some of them have, let's say, questionable designs. to be fair, though, they are still better than, say, being thrown away in the landfill or ultrafast-produced fast fashion stuffs, i suppose."

Depends on your budget and style but start shopping at Uniqlo and Banana Republic (on 40%+ sale) instead for good value basics.,depends on your budget and style but start shopping at uniqlo and banana republic on 40 sale instead for good value basics.
"If you are taking cost in into account then Uniqlo is probably the best bang for your buck. 

Grab a pair of selvedge jeans, pima cotton T shirts, airism underwear and undershirts. Then whatever else you need. 

Until you are done losing weight I wouldn't spend too much on more expensive versions. 

After that I would look at the American heritage style brands, particularly from Japan. Iron Heart makes stuff in larger sizes but check the measurement charts carefully since they are a Japanese brand and run a little small. 

For sweatshirts you can't go wrong with Wonderlooper but it comes at a premium.","if you are taking cost in into account then uniqlo is probably the best bang for your buck. grab a pair of selvedge jeans, pima cotton t shirts, airism underwear and undershirts. then whatever else you need. until you are done losing weight i wouldn't spend too much on more expensive versions. after that i would look at the american heritage style brands, particularly from japan. iron heart makes stuff in larger sizes but check the measurement charts carefully since they are a japanese brand and run a little small. for sweatshirts you can't go wrong with wonderlooper but it comes at a premium."
"Unbranded (denim), Bronson (basics/mil-surp), Spier & McKay (suits, OCBDs, knits). 

Those brands are a start but more importantly fit is king. Get a flat measuring tape and find your measurements, then measure clothes that fit you well, and compare them to size guides.

Everlane and Patagonia are my go-tos for exactly this reason! Both hit your sustainability checkbox and have inclusive sizing. Uniqlo's also surprisingly durable for the price point.

Keep in mind no matter how much you splurge on clothing even the best quality garments will go downhill quickly if not cared for properly.

"Another option that most guys don’t consider is eBay. 

For a comparable cost (maybe a bit more) to something boxy, bulky and poorly made from The Gap or H&M, you can get yourself into high-end menswear like Todd Snyder or RL. This includes your basics.

And they’re almost exclusively sold by vintage stores with high user reviews. Plus, it’s eBay - so you can make them an offer and many times they’ll jump on it.

I’ve donated years worth of generic crap in favour of a smaller wardrobe largely made up of eBay finds. My stuff fits better and looks better, and holy hell it’s all built to last.

"I bought an ASUS TUF F15 in August 2021, my first ever gaming laptop (specs in flair)

It was working fine, then in early 2022, the WiFi chip (a MediaTek one) started giving out, resulting in my online classes and tuitions getting disrupted. Although I fixed it with an external adapter, the Bluetooth is in the same chip, so it goes off randomly too.

Then in 2024, with no physical damage whatsoever, the speaker membrane got damaged and it resulted in an awful crackling sound, which I got a temporary fix. I also got it cleaned and repasted then.

Now, I doubt the GPU fan has some issues, since my games are performing really poorly and G-Helper shows GPU fan RPM at 0, and also the temporary fix for my speakers is starting to fall apart.

Honestly this has ruined my experience with TUF, and my dad was pissed he spent so much on an abomination

">why do you think gaming laptops are still worth it despite the costs and lack of upgrade abilities compared to desktops?

It only has worth to those who actually need the performance to be portable, and it's not possible to use an SFF PC or use a work laptop and have a separate desktop at home.

Gaming laptops are pretty niche in that sense that while they will never be on par with a dedicated desktop for gaming, or on par with a non-gaming laptop for battery efficiency, they're still a whole lot more portable than a desktop setup and more powerful than a non-gaming laptop for graphical use. If your use case needs both portability and power, and would like have just one machine, then it makes it worth it for you.","why do you think gaming laptops are still worth it despite the costs and lack of upgrade abilities compared to desktops it only has worth to those who actually need the performance to be portable, and it's not possible to use an sff pc or use a work laptop and have a separate desktop at home. gaming laptops are pretty niche in that sense that while they will never be on par with a dedicated desktop for gaming, or on par with a non-gaming laptop for battery efficiency, they're still a whole lot more portable than a desktop setup and more powerful than a non-gaming laptop for graphical use. if your use case needs both portability and power, and would like have just one machine, then it makes it worth it for you."

"I was all very pro desktop until my last one crapped out on me and everything was already out of date on it - even the case. My previous work laptop was a gaming laptop we bought 10 years ago where the GPU recently crapped out on me. We're still using it in the company though. It's outlasted our server.

"Fujitsu, Eurocom, I've heard mixed things about Dynabook but maybe.

Used to be Lenovo, not anymore for sure. Dell makes cheap dogshit now, so does HP for the most part on the consumer part but if you can get a HP workstation laptop those tend to be pretty good.

There was some German brand, I think Tuxedo? They aren't really tested yet but from what I've seen they would be the type to focus on long-term life of their products.","fujitsu, eurocom, i've heard mixed things about dynabook but maybe. used to be lenovo, not anymore for sure. dell makes cheap dogshit now, so does hp for the most part on the consumer part but if you can get a hp workstation laptop those tend to be pretty good. there was some german brand, i think tuxedo they aren't really tested yet but from what i've seen they would be the type to focus on long-term life of their products."

"Other than Apple, there are no brands that focus on that across their entire lineup. But most brands do have a sub-brand or several which are designed and built as daily use workhorses.

Lenovo's ThinkPads are one of those. I've had a lot of them and haven't experienced wifi issues with them. Dell has their Latitude series - or Pro with their new naming system (Pro Plus and Pro Premium are nice). HP has EliteBooks and ZBooks that fit the description. Asus has ExpertBook series.

"Macs.

I don't like Apple and I don't use their products, but it is clear that their devices can last. In fact, from what I remember, device's degrading performance used to be done by apple through software updates, because their hardware is just super good. Assholes.

Lenovos as largely reliable. I ran a business with a fleet of 10 or so lenovos and one of them had issues and levono fixed it inmediately. 

HPs are absolute crap. They lost me as a customer years ago. 

In any case, much better to buy a 1-3 year old, highly specced laptop than a cheap new one. Everything below 500 Euros is e-waste at this point. Except for Chuwi. Solid machines for the ridiculous price. Again, you get what you pay for.

The specific model is more important than the brand in terms of quality and longevity with the business models generally having the best builds. I have a 2014 HP ProBook which is still very fast and reliable. I only just recently replaced it with a new ProBook because I thought that I couldn't upgrade it to Win 11. The 2014 ProBook is running Win 10 which won't be supported by Microsoft after 10/2025. The weak point for most laptops are the screen hinges and the ProBook's appear to be strong.,the specific model is more important than the brand in terms of quality and longevity with the business models generally having the best builds. i have a 2014 hp probook which is still very fast and reliable. i only just recently replaced it with a new probook because i thought that i couldn't upgrade it to win 11. the 2014 probook is running win 10 which won't be supported by microsoft after 102025. the weak point for most laptops are the screen hinges and the probook's appear to be strong.
"Depends on how lucky you are...

I have bought lots of them in the past, for the companies I've worked for, I have used Acer, Fujitsu-Siemens, HP, Dell, and Thinkpads.

A mix of brands at the beginning, Acer had a terrible after-sales department/service.

Fujitsu-Siemens was expensive for the options and not worth it... some of them came with dead batteries from the factory.

we started buying HP afterwards, most of them had electrical problems.

Then we switched to IBM and after that Lenovo, their thinkpads are still working fine, never have got any issue caused by the hardware.

Can't say about Dell, not enough experience with them.

Being in the industrial programming business, can't say anything about macs either.

Given my experience I'd say Thinkpads, but that can be completely different for someone else...

  
Lenovo is the first world seller (in units), they have great company options and great warranty options too (international upgrades with 24 hours replacement granted even for accidental damage), and their Vantage software keeps your drivers and propietary software up to date.","depends on how lucky you are... i have bought lots of them in the past, for the companies i've worked for, i have used acer, fujitsu-siemens, hp, dell, and thinkpads. a mix of brands at the beginning, acer had a terrible after-sales departmentservice. fujitsu-siemens was expensive for the options and not worth it... some of them came with dead batteries from the factory. we started buying hp afterwards, most of them had electrical problems. then we switched to ibm and after that lenovo, their thinkpads are still working fine, never have got any issue caused by the hardware. can't say about dell, not enough experience with them. being in the industrial programming business, can't say anything about macs either. given my experience i'd say thinkpads, but that can be completely different for someone else... lenovo is the first world seller in units, they have great company options and great warranty options too international upgrades with 24 hours replacement granted even for accidental damage, and their vantage software keeps your drivers and propietary software up to date."

"MacBook generally have the best quality these days. As for windows, the consistency is not good no matter which brand you go. Personally I think dynabook is one of the best for smaller machines and HP Elitebook 10 series as the most reliable big brand. 

FYI, I am a semi reseller and IT fans. My company used all HP and no hassle at all as well as their support. We sold many dynabooks and only few had a battery issue. Far better than ThinkPad(Yep, we encountered DOA which is intolerable these days) Panasonic is also good but very limited coverage in the USA, maintenance would be a nightmare. 

What's more, you need to spend at least 1500USD for a decent laptop these days. And use only a bigger name parts. Like Kingston Fury RAM, Crucial RAM and some OEM part like SKHynix(they are the best for DDR5), Samsung 990Pro 4T(no 0E issue ever), SK Hynix P41. P31. They are tested and true parts. If you buy knockoffs like kingbok, you may have good chance for money as well as quality but you may get into trouble as their source is different than premium .

"If reliability is what you are after MacBook is the only option I can think of. Their laptops can easily last over 5 years and still run fast. You won’t have any driver issue after numerous updates since Apple controls both hardware and software. Their M1 was released year 2020 and it’s still very fast and receiving update to date. 10+ hours of use is a breeze since MacOS is very stable. As of writing my uptime is 21 days already and no lag/slowdown at all.

For windows laptop I'd lean towards Asus. My laptop when I was in college was an i5 Asus with Nvidia. The build quality is really solid. It was tortured for years (falls while inside the bag from the armchair, squeezed in my bag together with some books and sometimes clothes, there was a time I accidentally sat on it on the couch) and it survived through college. After some time I noticed that there were like whitish parts kinda like when you apply pressure from the back of the monitor. Probably the screen's case got a bit deformed from the frequent pressure applied to it. I just ignored it since the screen for that model is not that good anyways. At that point I no longer need the portability part so I just hooked up a monitor.

I only started having major issues after around 4 years. Some keys on the keyboard were a bit hard to detect when pressed until eventually it stopped working. Keyboard can easily be replaced but since I use it like a PC at that point and have it hooked up with a monitor, wireless keyboard and mouse, I just left it be.","if reliability is what you are after macbook is the only option i can think of. their laptops can easily last over 5 years and still run fast. you won't have any driver issue after numerous updates since apple controls both hardware and software. their m1 was released year 2020 and it's still very fast and receiving update to date. 10 hours of use is a breeze since macos is very stable. as of writing my uptime is 21 days already and no lagslowdown at all. for windows laptop i'd lean towards asus. my laptop when i was in college was an i5 asus with nvidia. the build quality is really solid. it was tortured for years falls while inside the bag from the armchair, squeezed in my bag together with some books and sometimes clothes, there was a time i accidentally sat on it on the couch and it survived through college. after some time i noticed that there were like whitish parts kinda like when you apply pressure from the back of the monitor. probably the screen's case got a bit deformed from the frequent pressure applied to it. i just ignored it since the screen for that model is not that good anyways. at that point i no longer need the portability part so i just hooked up a monitor. i only started having major issues after around 4 years. some keys on the keyboard were a bit hard to detect when pressed until eventually it stopped working. keyboard can easily be replaced but since i use it like a pc at that point and have it hooked up with a monitor, wireless keyboard and mouse, i just left it be."

"As others are pointing out it's really more down to the model than the brand. 

I work in IT(tech support) for a company that has around 100 laptops. Lenovo(Thinkpads), HP(Probook,Zbook series), Dell(Latitude and XPS and Precision series).

The least amount of work I have to do(hardware and software glitches) are 100% on Thinkpads but the Zbook line also seems to be decent from HP.

In general Lenovo Thinkpad series has been known for its reliability. Some say it changed and I can't comment on that at least not yet.

But if you are planning on using a laptop with a dock, then it's something like this.

1. Lenovo
2. Dell
3. HP(80% of dock related issues I need to fix are on HP laptops paired with HP docks. But 50% of the company is on HP so think of that what you will)

If I would have to grossly generalise, I would say Lenovo is the best out of the mainstream brands(but again, focus on the model or the very least the product line).

"Best Reliable collection by me,

**🍎 Apple (MacBooks)**

* **Super reliable**, especially if you don’t mind macOS.
* Built like a tank, gets updates for years.
* Downside: expensive to buy *and* expensive to fix.
* But if you treat it well, it’ll probably last you 5–7 years easy.

**💼 Lenovo (ThinkPad line especially)**

* The **ThinkPad series** (like T or X series) is known for being solid and durable — like business tanks.
* Great keyboard, easy to repair, parts are available.
* Avoid the cheap IdeaPad models — they’re hit or miss.

**💻 Dell (XPS & Latitude series)**

* **XPS** is like Dell’s answer to the MacBook: sleek, strong, reliable.
* **Latitude** is their business line, also built to last.
* Cheaper Dell laptops (Inspiron, Vostro) can be OK but watch out for heating and build quality issues.

**📎 HP (EliteBook series is good)**

* HP’s business laptops = good stuff (EliteBook, ZBook).
* Their cheaper consumer laptops? Not as great — more likely to have issues.

"It really depends on your budget. Normally i recommend (to my clients) higher end Dell Latitude, HP Elitebook or Thinkpad. But I understand you don't want a Lenovo. Also, the Microsoft Surface Laptop from the business division is good quality.

If you want a lot of tabs open, then I would suggest 32GB of RAM.

Do you have a budget in mind? The Dell Pro 14 Premium is pretty nice. But expensive. You can also order it with an OLED screen if that's is important to you. I would also recommend Pro Support warranty or Pro Support with accidental Damage warranty. 

The less expensive laptops will be plastic. The more expensive ones will be aluminum or magnesium.

"The laptop's wifi is mostly based on the wifi chip, most laptops let you swap them out fairly easily...

Budget laptops come with budget wifi chips. You can buy a new one and swap it if you want, or take note of it before you buy a laptop.

Lenovo uses different wifi chips depending on the laptop, I've never bought their laptop or suggested it, but avoiding a company due to a bad experience with 1 networking chip on 1 laptop is a poor reason. They buy the same wifi chips that many other laptop companies do. There are only like 3 relevant companies that make those chips... Even the good wifi chip brands like Intel sometimes make bad chips that only show signs a few years later.

Also, the battery in all electronics will degrade by a large amount over the years. I honestly wouldn't expect any current gen battery to last 5+ years, I'm not sure how important that is to you. But if the battery isn't important then I'd get a pc anyways...","the laptop's wifi is mostly based on the wifi chip, most laptops let you swap them out fairly easily... budget laptops come with budget wifi chips. you can buy a new one and swap it if you want, or take note of it before you buy a laptop. lenovo uses different wifi chips depending on the laptop, i've never bought their laptop or suggested it, but avoiding a company due to a bad experience with 1 networking chip on 1 laptop is a poor reason. they buy the same wifi chips that many other laptop companies do. there are only like 3 relevant companies that make those chips... even the good wifi chip brands like intel sometimes make bad chips that only show signs a few years later. also, the battery in all electronics will degrade by a large amount over the years. i honestly wouldn't expect any current gen battery to last 5 years, i'm not sure how important that is to you. but if the battery isn't important then i'd get a pc anyways..."

"Unfortunately this is the downside of Windows devices vs Macs - Apple don't make cut-price shit models, Windows laptop makers do. The higher end is very equivalent with the Windows devices being more flexible in what software and games they can run, but the low end is shit vs nothing, and it gives Windows devices a hell of a bad name.

Going on Currys/PCWorld (I'm in the UK) the cheapest Windows laptop they sell has an Intel Celeron 4020 CPU (which was shit in 2019, let alone now), 4GB of RAM (*not* enough), and 64 GB of EMMC storage (essentially a soldered-in SD card). It's *only £149*, and they clearly skimped on *everything*. It's essentially brand new ewaste. Apple wouldn't be caught dead selling something so bad. I truly feel sorry for anyone tricked into buying one thinking it's a good deal.

However if you buy something *actually decent*, with an Intel Core / AMD Ryzen CPU, 16GB RAM, and an actual SSD for storage... you can have a decent experience for only £400. £500 if you want something really solid.

Likely the company you work for just skimped. If you can tell us the specs (you can get the CPU / RAM from task manager) we can probably prove it. Your laptop is likely one of ancient, a useless ultra-bargain model, or both.","unfortunately this is the downside of windows devices vs macs - apple don't make cut-price shit models, windows laptop makers do. the higher end is very equivalent with the windows devices being more flexible in what software and games they can run, but the low end is shit vs nothing, and it gives windows devices a hell of a bad name. going on curryspcworld i'm in the uk the cheapest windows laptop they sell has an intel celeron 4020 cpu which was shit in 2019, let alone now, 4gb of ram not enough, and 64 gb of emmc storage essentially a soldered-in sd card. it's only 149, and they clearly skimped on everything. it's essentially brand new ewaste. apple wouldn't be caught dead selling something so bad. i truly feel sorry for anyone tricked into buying one thinking it's a good deal. however if you buy something actually decent, with an intel core amd ryzen cpu, 16gb ram, and an actual ssd for storage... you can have a decent experience for only 400. 500 if you want something really solid. likely the company you work for just skimped. if you can tell us the specs you can get the cpu ram from task manager we can probably prove it. your laptop is likely one of ancient, a useless ultra-bargain model, or both."

"Went to Matt Moran's restaurant at the Art Gallery NSW last week and regret it.

Very ordinary food. The beef tartare was inedible, way too thick and smothered in sour cream (to disguise the taste?).

Th fish was dry and tasteless... supposed to be catch of the day but def. frozen. The only good thing was the sauce on the crumbed scallops. Dessert was fine, but its not hard to make creamy sugary things delicious.

And tthey were playing pop music... Walked in to Abba! At the Art Galler? I don't underestimate Abba but it was just in a mix of easy listening pop hits. It seemed really out of place.

The staff were sweet. We gave our server a big tip for having to serve such shitty food and keeping graceful about it, lol.

Overall a waste of (a lot of) money. Would not recommend.","went to matt moran's restaurant at the art gallery nsw last week and regret it. very ordinary food. the beef tartare was inedible, way too thick and smothered in sour cream to disguise the taste. th fish was dry and tasteless... supposed to be catch of the day but def. frozen. the only good thing was the sauce on the crumbed scallops. dessert was fine, but its not hard to make creamy sugary things delicious. and tthey were playing pop music... walked in to abba at the art galler i don't underestimate abba but it was just in a mix of easy listening pop hits. it seemed really out of place. the staff were sweet. we gave our server a big tip for having to serve such shitty food and keeping graceful about it, lol. overall a waste of a lot of money. would not recommend."

"I used to love Rockpool. One of our vendors took us there for lunch a few months back. Ordered a $90 scotch fillet that was so chewy I threw half the steak out.

Edited to elaborate:
R&D and menu design is largely done by the individual teams in venue, with some feedback and occasional pointers from Dan. 

The ambience comes from Justin and Bettina Hemmes, as well as their in house styling teams and the architecture firms they hire for venue openings. 

I by no means mean to say it’s a name attached like a franchise, just that he gets a lot more credit than (in my opinion) is deserved. He absolutely mentors some of the chefs as they work their way up the ranks, but he is certainly not hands on full time in all of those venues.

"I really like dining in the bar area at Rockpool bar and grill.

You can either sit at the bar which I think is awesome even if you’re on a date since you get extra special attention from the friendly bartenders  or they have seating too.

The bar menu is excellent and you can order anything from the restaurant too! Plus you can ask for the main courses to be split in two.

My usual order is:
Empanadas
Prawn cutlet
Main pasta dish split in two.
2 x steak Dianne(actually the most underrated steak in Sydney imo) or steak chimichuri from the bar menu OR ribeye from the grill to share.
Side of butter lettuce, fat chips and wagyu gravy
Dessert to share

Wine: their list is huge and extensive and you will find something in your price range, they’ve been known for one of the biggest private wine collections before and their sommeliers are excellent. Having said that if you wanna go the same old Barossa Shiraz route you’re gonna pay for it but the menu has plenty of hidden affordable gems if you chat to the somms. Had an incredible 10 year old German Riesling for $80 there a few months ago.

I do that menu with my wife frequently and comes to around $220~.

This imo is how you do restaurants(as someone who has worked in hospo for 15 years), little bit of this and that from each menu. And it’s a good amount of food.

Also don’t be scared to sit at the bar and get friendly with the staff, I think it really elevates your experience.

Good luck and have fun!","i really like dining in the bar area at rockpool bar and grill. you can either sit at the bar which i think is awesome even if you're on a date since you get extra special attention from the friendly bartenders or they have seating too. the bar menu is excellent and you can order anything from the restaurant too plus you can ask for the main courses to be split in two. my usual order is empanadas prawn cutlet main pasta dish split in two. 2 x steak dianneactually the most underrated steak in sydney imo or steak chimichuri from the bar menu or ribeye from the grill to share. side of butter lettuce, fat chips and wagyu gravy dessert to share wine their list is huge and extensive and you will find something in your price range, they've been known for one of the biggest private wine collections before and their sommeliers are excellent. having said that if you wanna go the same old barossa shiraz route you're gonna pay for it but the menu has plenty of hidden affordable gems if you chat to the somms. had an incredible 10 year old german riesling for 80 there a few months ago. i do that menu with my wife frequently and comes to around 220. this imo is how you do restaurantsas someone who has worked in hospo for 15 years, little bit of this and that from each menu. and it's a good amount of food. also don't be scared to sit at the bar and get friendly with the staff, i think it really elevates your experience. good luck and have fun"

"Probably my Nokia Lumia 930. A fucking WINDOWS phone. Only a few things ran on it and since I got it used from a relative, the battery was already down to okay and went to bad after the close to 3 years I've had it for. [Musical.ly](http://Musical.ly) (yes, I still remember that) would've cost while it was free on android or apple. My Huawei P10 Lite I had next was pretty great, I only replaced it after like 4.5 years due to a cracked screen and the battery barely lasting a day due to being on like 68%. My Galaxy A52s has honestly been perfect. Good screen (though too dim in direct sunlight when watching a dark scene in movies or series), good battery life, good battery longevity (still over 85% after three and a half years). I got an S23 FE Exynos from the company I started working for last year. I have mixed opinions on it. For once, it's really snappy with a decently bright screen but it's got quite sharp edges and the bezels are thicker than those of my A52s. It also uses a TON of power. I'm talking spikes of up to 14W. It does play Fortnite though, my A52s struggles heavily with it. Battery life is meh thanks to the Exynos and its massive power draw. It also only lasts 2 min once it reaches 5% and gets really, really laggy.","probably my nokia lumia 930. a fucking windows phone. only a few things ran on it and since i got it used from a relative, the battery was already down to okay and went to bad after the close to 3 years i've had it for. musical.ly yes, i still remember that would've cost while it was free on android or apple. my huawei p10 lite i had next was pretty great, i only replaced it after like 4.5 years due to a cracked screen and the battery barely lasting a day due to being on like 68. my galaxy a52s has honestly been perfect. good screen though too dim in direct sunlight when watching a dark scene in movies or series, good battery life, good battery longevity still over 85 after three and a half years. i got an s23 fe exynos from the company i started working for last year. i have mixed opinions on it. for once, it's really snappy with a decently bright screen but it's got quite sharp edges and the bezels are thicker than those of my a52s. it also uses a ton of power. i'm talking spikes of up to 14w. it does play fortnite though, my a52s struggles heavily with it. battery life is meh thanks to the exynos and its massive power draw. it also only lasts 2 min once it reaches 5 and gets really, really laggy."

"The Xperia Z5 Compact.

It came with less RAM than the standard version, which meant it was slow and suffered from crashes despite having a powerful processor.

On the other hand, despite having a top-notch camera sensor, the software was terrible and didn't get the most out of it.

It overheated a lot, and the battery quickly degraded.
The back was made of glass, and despite having a case, it shattered into pieces and ended up falling apart.
The touch sensor was on the side and didn't work properly.

"Everything from Samsung was rather bad. 
I had the XCover, in various issues like XCover 3 and so on. 
At the time Samsung was the only supplier for ""affordable"" tough phones. 
They were all weak in CPU and RAM. Thankfully some had expendable storage. 
The first was the only tough one. Nearly indestructible. 
The third broke from a drop of less than knee height. That's when I left. 
Also Samsung gives you Samsung apps for ""every"" Google app there is. 
That's double the bloatware. 
Annoying and useless. I don't need two apps for notes, or files, or pictures thank you. 
I feel Samsung is generally bad. Sure big, but bad. 
I used some Chinese models (doogee, and something else) they all failed within 2 years, which is too annoying for me.
I changed to Google, because I don't really need a tough phone anymore. A good case and a waterproof phone are enough now. And using a Google android means there is only one grabby kraken collecting my data.","everything from samsung was rather bad. i had the xcover, in various issues like xcover 3 and so on. at the time samsung was the only supplier for ""affordable"" tough phones. they were all weak in cpu and ram. thankfully some had expendable storage. the first was the only tough one. nearly indestructible. the third broke from a drop of less than knee height. that's when i left. also samsung gives you samsung apps for ""every"" google app there is. that's double the bloatware. annoying and useless. i don't need two apps for notes, or files, or pictures thank you. i feel samsung is generally bad. sure big, but bad. i used some chinese models doogee, and something else they all failed within 2 years, which is too annoying for me. i changed to google, because i don't really need a tough phone anymore. a good case and a waterproof phone are enough now. and using a google android means there is only one grabby kraken collecting my data."

iPhones are much better than they were. Back then, I was coming from, if I remember correctly, a Windows Mobile device. The iPhone was more stable, but the stupid thing couldn't actually DO anything, which was why it was so stable. 😂

"Sony Ericsson Xperia X10 Mini Pro, 2010-2012

I honestly didn't know what I'm getting into. But finding out that my phone runs Android and is updatable, got me intrigued and excited at first. But it left me disappointed when I read that the manufacturer won't update to the Android version that supports App2SD. It prevented me from using otherwise compatible apps that took more storage than what was available in the device itself. Android seemed like a somewhat standardized operating system, but - unlike what I experienced on PCs - needed heavy customization by the manufacturer to run at all on the device. This realization dragged me to Custom ROMs, which was exciting for some time, until the always broken home-made ROMs by some randoes (no offense, thanks for the effort) made me tired of the whole thing.

Some apps like VLC Player or a Nintendo 64 emulator were announced months if not years before release and ended up not being compatible with the ARMv6 SoC in the device. Huge disappointment.

I was so pissed that from 2012 up until 2018 I switched to Windows Phone and only returned upon Microsoft's announcement that the platform will be discontinued. I'm back to Android, because I stubbornly refuse to get an iPhone, but I don't hate Android as much as back then, although I'd prefer not to use Android and have a third option.","sony ericsson xperia x10 mini pro, 2010-2012 i honestly didn't know what i'm getting into. but finding out that my phone runs android and is updatable, got me intrigued and excited at first. but it left me disappointed when i read that the manufacturer won't update to the android version that supports app2sd. it prevented me from using otherwise compatible apps that took more storage than what was available in the device itself. android seemed like a somewhat standardized operating system, but - unlike what i experienced on pcs - needed heavy customization by the manufacturer to run at all on the device. this realization dragged me to custom roms, which was exciting for some time, until the always broken home-made roms by some randoes no offense, thanks for the effort made me tired of the whole thing. some apps like vlc player or a nintendo 64 emulator were announced months if not years before release and ended up not being compatible with the armv6 soc in the device. huge disappointment. i was so pissed that from 2012 up until 2018 i switched to windows phone and only returned upon microsoft's announcement that the platform will be discontinued. i'm back to android, because i stubbornly refuse to get an iphone, but i don't hate android as much as back then, although i'd prefer not to use android and have a third option."

"Always the cheap ones. I had a motorola moto... G7? I dont remember exactly. Maybe g6? It was around 2017. Camera? Not great but I didn't care.

Eventually it refused to turbo charge, and after that It would only charge if I turned the phone on in some developer mode to bypass whatever the heck was preventing it in the OS.

I bought it because I needed a rugged phone to take camping, to music festivals, canoeing etc. It also has really good specs for a rugged phone, which I wanted as I want to be able to use it for everything I use my normal phone for.

The downside: I had no idea it was possible to implement stock Android this wrong.

Also, there was a camera and website access the Nokia didn't have. This sounds like a huge upgrade, but they were unusable.

"Galaxy s7 edge. Loved the look and innovation of a curved edge screen, sounded and looked cool on paper and in videos/pictures. But in practice I would accidentally touch or do a gesture due to the edges. Also, constantly had issues where the phone would be sitting in my pocket, not in use, would leave the house with 100% battery and it would randomly get extremely hot and drain battery to like 40%. Towards the end of my first year with my phone I had to put the phone in power saving mode to last the day, I had cleared the cache and Uninstalled some apps that just drained battery in the background to resolve the issue. I wasn't familiar with android phones so learning to manage it was a little extra leg work, and even then I'd still randomly have moments where the phone would heat up and would require a reboot. After the first year, my phone had trouble lasting an entire day on 1 charge. Then, if overheating wasn't happening, my phone would have random moments of being extremely slow. Apps weren't well optimized for the galaxy phones yet, but this experience was enough to get me to switch and stay with apple for the next 10 ish years. Now I'm back with the s25 ultra, and it's been a better experience thus far.","galaxy s7 edge. loved the look and innovation of a curved edge screen, sounded and looked cool on paper and in videospictures. but in practice i would accidentally touch or do a gesture due to the edges. also, constantly had issues where the phone would be sitting in my pocket, not in use, would leave the house with 100 battery and it would randomly get extremely hot and drain battery to like 40. towards the end of my first year with my phone i had to put the phone in power saving mode to last the day, i had cleared the cache and uninstalled some apps that just drained battery in the background to resolve the issue. i wasn't familiar with android phones so learning to manage it was a little extra leg work, and even then i'd still randomly have moments where the phone would heat up and would require a reboot. after the first year, my phone had trouble lasting an entire day on 1 charge. then, if overheating wasn't happening, my phone would have random moments of being extremely slow. apps weren't well optimized for the galaxy phones yet, but this experience was enough to get me to switch and stay with apple for the next 10 ish years. now i'm back with the s25 ultra, and it's been a better experience thus far."

 It's greatest flaw was the plain android of most Motorolas.. hardware that couldn't shine due to settings. Just a ""1"" in a settings file and it had better video support. 

Update and Custom roms available. But saddly that meant losing the Swype keyboard that was one of the best keyboards.","i had the gsm version razr xt910 and overall it was great. really slim. survived lots of falls. but hadn't i known of xda forums i would have sold it. it's greatest flaw was the plain android of most motorolas.. hardware that couldn't shine due to settings. just a ""1"" in a settings file and it had better video support. update and custom roms available. but saddly that meant losing the swype keyboard that was one of the best keyboards."

"Nokia X2.


Out of 27 phones I've had till now, the Nokia X2 was probably the worst. It lagged as hell and had a terrible app store with barely any apps (it ran a forked version of Android 4.2, without Google Services). The camera quality was jaggy, plus the microphone was VERY muffled, too. The only good thing was the design and its bright orange color - that was a lovely color!

"Oh hey, this happened to my Nexus 5X on the second day of my vacation to Prague. I had to fumble my way to a Vodafone store and buy some cheap Huawei phone so I could continue my trip. Basically everything was through my phone - reservations, maps, tickets - so I was crippled without it.


However, when I got back home, Google actually replaced the phone for me even though it was out of the warranty period. I kept it going for a couple of years after that, finally switching to a Galaxy S9+, which was a great phone for the five years I kept it.","oh hey, this happened to my nexus 5x on the second day of my vacation to prague. i had to fumble my way to a vodafone store and buy some cheap huawei phone so i could continue my trip. basically everything was through my phone - reservations, maps, tickets - so i was crippled without it. however, when i got back home, google actually replaced the phone for me even though it was out of the warranty period. i kept it going for a couple of years after that, finally switching to a galaxy s9, which was a great phone for the five years i kept it."

Man I'm so sorry to hear that. I have the standard Pixel 7 which I got at launch. I really wanted to get the 7 Pro but I wasn't comfortable with having a curved display so I went with the regular 7 instead. So far it's been pretty solid for me with no issues except the fingerprint scanner and sometimes less than ideal battery life. But software wise it's been great. I'm looking forward to upgrading to the Pixel 11 series next year though because I want a TSMC made Tensor chip and I want a bigger display this time around.,man i'm so sorry to hear that. i have the standard pixel 7 which i got at launch. i really wanted to get the 7 pro but i wasn't comfortable with having a curved display so i went with the regular 7 instead. so far it's been pretty solid for me with no issues except the fingerprint scanner and sometimes less than ideal battery life. but software wise it's been great. i'm looking forward to upgrading to the pixel 11 series next year though because i want a tsmc made tensor chip and i want a bigger display this time around.

"Lol hey it's all good. Am I a Pixel fan, yes indeed and I'm not ashamed to admit it. But I also know everyone has different experiences with different phones. Plus I try to be as objective as possible regardless of the brand. I like Google's software the best but I know they don't have the best hardware. For that, I admire a lot of the Chinese brands for their hardware. 

In my personal experience, the two Pixel phones I've had so far have been the best devices I ever used. I had my beloved Pixel 2XL for 5 years and it worked flawlessly the whole time I had it. I never kept a phone that long and the only reason I upgraded to my current Pixel 7 at launch was because Google stopped supporting it and the battery life was highly degraded by the end of my time with it, which is expected. So far my Pixel 7 has been solid for almost 3 years now with little to no issues. These have been the best devices I've ever used software wise. I do hope Google continues to improve their hardware though.","lol hey it's all good. am i a pixel fan, yes indeed and i'm not ashamed to admit it. but i also know everyone has different experiences with different phones. plus i try to be as objective as possible regardless of the brand. i like google's software the best but i know they don't have the best hardware. for that, i admire a lot of the chinese brands for their hardware. in my personal experience, the two pixel phones i've had so far have been the best devices i ever used. i had my beloved pixel 2xl for 5 years and it worked flawlessly the whole time i had it. i never kept a phone that long and the only reason i upgraded to my current pixel 7 at launch was because google stopped supporting it and the battery life was highly degraded by the end of my time with it, which is expected. so far my pixel 7 has been solid for almost 3 years now with little to no issues. these have been the best devices i've ever used software wise. i do hope google continues to improve their hardware though."

"That's the sort of problem companies run into when they implement proprietary solutions instead of paying the licensing fees to vendors with well-established tech. Companies that use the Snapdragon SoC in their devices have to pay Qualcomm licensing fees. To reduce production costs, Samsung used their own Exynos SoC in some markets. Unfortunately, the proprietary solutions are often inferior. Case in point: Oneplus uses proprietary audio tech in the OP13 instead of licensing Dolby Atmos. The result was inferior sound quality as compared to other flagships that use Dolby.","that's the sort of problem companies run into when they implement proprietary solutions instead of paying the licensing fees to vendors with well-established tech. companies that use the snapdragon soc in their devices have to pay qualcomm licensing fees. to reduce production costs, samsung used their own exynos soc in some markets. unfortunately, the proprietary solutions are often inferior. case in point oneplus uses proprietary audio tech in the op13 instead of licensing dolby atmos. the result was inferior sound quality as compared to other flagships that use dolby."

I unfortunately never got a chance to use any of the Nexus phones because back when they were around I wasn't paying much attention to the Smartphone industry as I do now so I was unaware of the different models. It wasn't until around 2016 when I started to really gain a huge interest in the smartphone market. I had the Galaxy S6 at the time and the original Google Pixel was out that year and I began to be interested in Pixel phones because of the day 1 updates. So I decided to wait a year and got the 2XL which was my very first Google device and it changed the game for me. Fortunately I've had good experiences with both my 2XL and my current 7 which I've had for almost 3 years now.,i unfortunately never got a chance to use any of the nexus phones because back when they were around i wasn't paying much attention to the smartphone industry as i do now so i was unaware of the different models. it wasn't until around 2016 when i started to really gain a huge interest in the smartphone market. i had the galaxy s6 at the time and the original google pixel was out that year and i began to be interested in pixel phones because of the day 1 updates. so i decided to wait a year and got the 2xl which was my very first google device and it changed the game for me. fortunately i've had good experiences with both my 2xl and my current 7 which i've had for almost 3 years now.

"Man it's so unfortunate what happened with LG. Their phones were some of the most fun models I've used. I just wish they were more consistent. I guess LG redeemed itself greatly when I got my Pixel 2 XL since they were the ones who manufactured that legendary beast of a phone. But by that time I became hooked on Pixels and never looked back to either Samsung, Motorola, or LG.","man it's so unfortunate what happened with lg. their phones were some of the most fun models i've used. i just wish they were more consistent. i guess lg redeemed itself greatly when i got my pixel 2 xl since they were the ones who manufactured that legendary beast of a phone. but by that time i became hooked on pixels and never looked back to either samsung, motorola, or lg."

"Heyy. Good to know someone who used that phone. I don't remember all the problems i had but some that i still remember are :

- the navigation buttons very not very responsive. The transparent light bar was cool but the buttons were awkwardly placed and needed muktiple tappings

- wobbled like an unbalanced boat. Those were pre-case days so there was no solution for that

- the camera button. When I picked up my 16 pro max, i had a chuckle because this phone has a similarly unusable camera button. The camera in general was impressive and i bought the phone because of the camera memories from school days when sony ericsson used to have top cameras.","heyy. good to know someone who used that phone. i don't remember all the problems i had but some that i still remember are - the navigation buttons very not very responsive. the transparent light bar was cool but the buttons were awkwardly placed and needed muktiple tappings - wobbled like an unbalanced boat. those were pre-case days so there was no solution for that - the camera button. when i picked up my 16 pro max, i had a chuckle because this phone has a similarly unusable camera button. the camera in general was impressive and i bought the phone because of the camera memories from school days when sony ericsson used to have top cameras."

"Yeah, I've always loved the capabilities with Android. iPhone is just a phone that works, and has a good camera and long software support. That's really the only thing that it has going for it. But the recent iPhones have been a disappointing experience for me. Even so, I still think the XS and 11 are the best iPhones. My RedMagic 10 Pro has an amazing battery, it easily lasts me 2 days with normal usage, and maxed out everything, and 3 days if I turn off 5G, and turn the refresh rate down to 90hz. It never lags or freezes up on me, and it's instant as soon as I click something. It doesn't have the annoying animation delay that iOS has.","yeah, i've always loved the capabilities with android. iphone is just a phone that works, and has a good camera and long software support. that's really the only thing that it has going for it. but the recent iphones have been a disappointing experience for me. even so, i still think the xs and 11 are the best iphones. my redmagic 10 pro has an amazing battery, it easily lasts me 2 days with normal usage, and maxed out everything, and 3 days if i turn off 5g, and turn the refresh rate down to 90hz. it never lags or freezes up on me, and it's instant as soon as i click something. it doesn't have the annoying animation delay that ios has."

"It was a pretty weird experience. Like everyone else who bought that first model, I was excited to get a high-end-ish phone for less money. The specs were really good for the time. But then the ""fun"" began. First, news came out that this ""startup"" was really just a division of Oppo (a big Chinese phone maker) with a 22 year old figurehead (Carl Pei, current CEO of Nothing) at the top. Then all sorts of issues started arising, with the company doing nothing to rectify them. When I finally got rid of it, the phone couldn't even make phone calls, because the microphones had stopped filtering out ambient noise.

I'm sure they're better now (how could they not be?). But that definitely left a bad taste in my mouth about both OnePlus and Carl Pei.","it was a pretty weird experience. like everyone else who bought that first model, i was excited to get a high-end-ish phone for less money. the specs were really good for the time. but then the ""fun"" began. first, news came out that this ""startup"" was really just a division of oppo a big chinese phone maker with a 22 year old figurehead carl pei, current ceo of nothing at the top. then all sorts of issues started arising, with the company doing nothing to rectify them. when i finally got rid of it, the phone couldn't even make phone calls, because the microphones had stopped filtering out ambient noise. i'm sure they're better now how could they not be. but that definitely left a bad taste in my mouth about both oneplus and carl pei."

"Imo they were the golden era of smartphones. I can't remember exactly the models but LG made a nexus and Google made one, I believe the Google one was their first they manufactured themselves and there were differences in which android Software they used.

 The LG had a removable back plate while the Google was 1 piece. That Google nexus was the best phone I have ever had. The USB connector eventually failed as allllllll google phones do and i went for another nexus but they rebranded it as the pixel. I had the one that looked identical to iPhone at the time but had the round touch pad on the back.  This was my 2nd favorite and best phone.   Eventually tho, the usb failed and for whatever reason, it stopped letting me make/ take calls.   I could text no problem and do video call but it wouldn't function as a regular phone.

The first one was my beloved Pixel 2XL which I got in late 2017 and had all the way up until the release of the Pixel 7 in 2022. That phone worked flawlessly the whole time I had it. The only thing I didn't like about it was the screen, which was too dim in direct sunlight. But other than that, I didn't have a single issue with that phone. It made me a Pixel fan for the foreseeable future. The Pixel 7 is better in terms of the screen and the cameras, but the fingerprint scanner is a bit disappointing as it can be really inconsistent at times. But otherwise, the phone has performed well for me so far.

"Thank you for sharing your thoughts on this. What did you switch to afterwards? Are there preferred brands you like now?

The Verizon store didn't have a replacement model so they gave me the Droid Razr instead and it was ok at first but about a few months in, the battery life was HORRIBLE and the processor became super slow and laggy after a year with it.

We can still get the hint off that time from YouTube videos but offcourse using them was fun. don't worry u already have nice tech these days it's just we are so accustomed to all these features now to the point that we don't enjoy them because every phone has almost same stuff going on as mobile phone technology has reach to the point where its just a phone camera and social media stuff.. everything feels bland and boring these days as there is no new features to explore left. AI etc are just novel features. I remember back then phones used to deploy special buttons for quick FB or social media access directly on the phone eg HTC Chacha..as social media were starting to take off.,we can still get the hint off that time from youtube videos but offcourse using them was fun. don't worry u already have nice tech these days it's just we are so accustomed to all these features now to the point that we don't enjoy them because every phone has almost same stuff going on as mobile phone technology has reach to the point where its just a phone camera and social media stuff.. everything feels bland and boring these days as there is no new features to explore left. ai etc are just novel features. i remember back then phones used to deploy special buttons for quick fb or social media access directly on the phone eg htc chacha..as social media were starting to take off.
"I need to qualify my statements to say that Xiaomi does market segmentation so the same model may have different hardware and different network support depending on the region. So Chinese/Indian models are cheap but have poor network support for EU/NA. The 'global' models typically have much better network bands and nowadays seem to cover almost all the network bands needed for t-mobile.

The cheapest way to fix my 13 pro max is to replace the motherboard which is $200 on AliExpress.

"I've went through a lot of phones and I've settled mostly on OnePlus.  I've had the 6t, 7t, 8t, 12, and 13.  I also tried the 11 but returned it in favor of the Pixel 7 Pro.  Speaking of which, I've really tried to love Pixels but I have problems with almost every single one.  I'd prefer Pixel for the more open nature and day one updates.  OnePlus isn't far behind on updates though.

I also gave Samsung a fair try with the S24+ and S24 Ultra.  They can't capture active shots like my kids, especially playing sports.  I don't care how great Dex is or how many accessories are available if a $1200ish phone can't take a clear picture.  

I'm in the US sooo that's just about my only options.  I won't do iPhones due to lack of user control like no user accessible file system.  Motorola would be great (I really like the Thinkphone look) but they're behind on their cameras and software updates.","i've went through a lot of phones and i've settled mostly on oneplus. i've had the 6t, 7t, 8t, 12, and 13. i also tried the 11 but returned it in favor of the pixel 7 pro. speaking of which, i've really tried to love pixels but i have problems with almost every single one. i'd prefer pixel for the more open nature and day one updates. oneplus isn't far behind on updates though. i also gave samsung a fair try with the s24 and s24 ultra. they can't capture active shots like my kids, especially playing sports. i don't care how great dex is or how many accessories are available if a 1200ish phone can't take a clear picture. i'm in the us sooo that's just about my only options. i won't do iphones due to lack of user control like no user accessible file system. motorola would be great i really like the thinkphone look but they're behind on their cameras and software updates."

As a brand its hard to say, because I really dont agree with many software and pricing stuff that apple does. My android fav is samsung but samsung also makes some shit that bothers me to hell, like the constant copying, for example the watch ultra which isnt only a bad temu copy of the apple watch ultra but it also has horrendous software, its just oof, also why the f is the charging speed not up to the competitors yet?. Xiaomi and its subbrands make some cool shit but they also looove to copy which just looks very very bad sometimes and unoriginal. Google is okay in my eyes, I dont have favorites or beefs to pick with them. I had a huawei once and kinda liked that, the camera was peak, but recently they really aint doin it for me without google.

"I used to be a die hard Samsung fan in the earlier years when they allowed bootloader unlocks, etc but then Knox came and made things tons harder….Same thing for the Pixels, you have to pay your phone off in order for you to get the “OEM unlock” option to show up…so I completely gave up. Customizing Android isn’t fun like it used to be, but it’s still somewhat appealing…

I’ve gotten older (I’m 30 lol) and I want things to just work now…so I transitioned (again) over to the Apple ecosystem. The phones are supported for a decent time…it’s pretty, the cameras are amazing (but the 14 and 15 kinda went a tad downhill) organized and not fragmented like Android. **BUT EVERYTHING OVER HERE IS SUBSCRIPTION BASED!** and it’s quite annoying and sad.

While its far from perfect, I really like the fact that they are one of the few manufacturers making a truly compact flagship. Software side of it works great for me, since I like to have a good amount of customization so Oneui is perfect for me in that regard.

I’m just used to it now and using any Android feels weird. Plus, I own a MacBook, an Apple Watch, an iPad, and I love how seamlessly they work together. Most of my friends and family have iPhones as well, and while we use WhatsApp and Instagram here, using AirDrop is so convenient.

I don’t need to customize everything. I really prefer an OS where I feel I don’t need to change much and that’s what iOS is to me. I still can use the Google and Microsoft apps I need, the camera is good in any situation (including low light, moving objects and videos), and the in-app camera in social media apps preserves the image quality I want. The number of third party accessories is so much bigger. I have found great third party apps that suit my needs, some of them are iOS exclusives or simply work better on iOS. After sales service is better, at least in my country, and specially out of warranty service, while paid, it’s easy to find authorized providers compared to other brands. The phone will hold its value for longer when I ever decide to upgrade, and I can use it for years knowing I get the latest software updates in the same day as everyone else, regardless of the model.

"I am on Samsung S/Note series for a while now, I think at least 13 years. Switched back and forth between Note and S, but after having it all, landed on smallest S series phones, which is now more than capable of doing everything that I need. Why Samsung? I don't know honestly, but since I am in Europe, not all phones were available with the major carriers. Wanted to try Oneplus but never decided to give out that much money for a phone. Carrier renewed my contract every two years and with it gave me a huge discount on the phone. Stayed with one carrier throughout that period and basically the choice was then Samsung or Apple. 
In their defence, their S lines are excellent. I've resold every phone after two years for 2-3x what I paid for it. Camera is good, battery is usually inside those two years good. Never had any major issues (besides their own cpu). Fairly easy to transfer to a new phone, know where are things despite small changes. Like the design and the size.","i am on samsung snote series for a while now, i think at least 13 years. switched back and forth between note and s, but after having it all, landed on smallest s series phones, which is now more than capable of doing everything that i need. why samsung i don't know honestly, but since i am in europe, not all phones were available with the major carriers. wanted to try oneplus but never decided to give out that much money for a phone. carrier renewed my contract every two years and with it gave me a huge discount on the phone. stayed with one carrier throughout that period and basically the choice was then samsung or apple. in their defence, their s lines are excellent. i've resold every phone after two years for 2-3x what i paid for it. camera is good, battery is usually inside those two years good. never had any major issues besides their own cpu. fairly easy to transfer to a new phone, know where are things despite small changes. like the design and the size."

"Has to be Samsung for me but it's complicated. 🤣 I've had a lot of brands but I won't mention the ones which no longer exist. 

My first smart phone was the iPhone and I was Apple until the 4S. I then switched to Android and fell in love with the ability to customise the hell out of my phone so I knew I'd never go back to iPhone! 

I was Samsung from the S7 Edge until the S23 Plus but wanted to go stock Android for a while so the Pixel 9 Pro XL was the phone to push me to make the switch. Love the stock Android experience... Didn't so much love the hardware after so many years with the speed and reliability of Samsung. 

Needless to say, the Pixel issues became too much after six months and I went back to Samsung, now on the S25 Plus. I can ot fault Samsung and their hardware. They really know how to build a solid device and on that front, they're up there with Apple. The Pixel definitely has the edge when it comes to software if you want a clean and seamless experience. But I'm afraid I don't think think their hardware or durability is quite there yet.","has to be samsung for me but it's complicated. i've had a lot of brands but i won't mention the ones which no longer exist. my first smart phone was the iphone and i was apple until the 4s. i then switched to android and fell in love with the ability to customise the hell out of my phone so i knew i'd never go back to iphone i was samsung from the s7 edge until the s23 plus but wanted to go stock android for a while so the pixel 9 pro xl was the phone to push me to make the switch. love the stock android experience... didn't so much love the hardware after so many years with the speed and reliability of samsung. needless to say, the pixel issues became too much after six months and i went back to samsung, now on the s25 plus. i can ot fault samsung and their hardware. they really know how to build a solid device and on that front, they're up there with apple. the pixel definitely has the edge when it comes to software if you want a clean and seamless experience. but i'm afraid i don't think think their hardware or durability is quite there yet."
"I haven't yet owned two phones from the same brand (unless we consider pre-smartphones, in which case I've had three Samsungs now), but based on the experience I have had:

\- Huawei (some cheap circa 2012 phone): Was pretty impressive for the price. Though also, was my first smartphone so it was going to impress me no matter what. Replaced because I wanted something fancier.  
\- Samsung (Galaxy S3, Exynos version): Amazing phone. Only replaced because it got old.  
\- Meizu (M3 Note): Adequate. Nothing special, did the job. Replaced in the end because the charger port wore out, after earlier replacing it with the next one on this list as an ""upgrade"" but quickly switching back.  
\- Blackview (P10000 Pro): Extremely impressive battery. Literally everything else about it sucked ass - couldn't reliably connect to mobile networks, was sluggish, camera wasn't particularly great. Ended up getting rid of it and going back to the Meizu.  
\- Xiaomi (Redmi Note 7): Adequate. Ads in system apps were quite annoying. Otherwise, was good value for the price. Also replaced because the charger port wore out.  
\- Oppo (A94 5G): Very solid device, no complaints. Replaced due to update end-of-life.  
\- Apple (iPhone 12): Also very solid device, but a lot of the minor differences from Android still irritate me a bit even after \~6 months of using it. In particular I love how Apple Pay just works, every time, unlike Google Pay which was always a bit of a hassle. I would not have purchased an iPhone, but I won one in a contest and had it sitting in a drawer planning to sell it, then when I realised I needed a new phone, I was like ""screw it, let's just use that one"".

If I was buying a new phone now, it'd be a toss-up between Oppo and Samsung. I'm probably not buying another one until my current one either breaks or is no longer supported for updates though, and I think that's still quite a while off for this model.","i haven't yet owned two phones from the same brand unless we consider pre-smartphones, in which case i've had three samsungs now, but based on the experience i have had - huawei some cheap circa 2012 phone was pretty impressive for the price. though also, was my first smartphone so it was going to impress me no matter what. replaced because i wanted something fancier. - samsung galaxy s3, exynos version amazing phone. only replaced because it got old. - meizu m3 note adequate. nothing special, did the job. replaced in the end because the charger port wore out, after earlier replacing it with the next one on this list as an ""upgrade"" but quickly switching back. - blackview p10000 pro extremely impressive battery. literally everything else about it sucked ass - couldn't reliably connect to mobile networks, was sluggish, camera wasn't particularly great. ended up getting rid of it and going back to the meizu. - xiaomi redmi note 7 adequate. ads in system apps were quite annoying. otherwise, was good value for the price. also replaced because the charger port wore out. - oppo a94 5g very solid device, no complaints. replaced due to update end-of-life. - apple iphone 12 also very solid device, but a lot of the minor differences from android still irritate me a bit even after 6 months of using it. in particular i love how apple pay just works, every time, unlike google pay which was always a bit of a hassle. i would not have purchased an iphone, but i won one in a contest and had it sitting in a drawer planning to sell it, then when i realised i needed a new phone, i was like ""screw it, let's just use that one"". if i was buying a new phone now, it'd be a toss-up between oppo and samsung. i'm probably not buying another one until my current one either breaks or is no longer supported for updates though, and i think that's still quite a while off for this model."

"Google in my opinion just needs to continue to hone in on their hardware. They are my preferred phones, but I always call them out for the things they need to work on. That being said, I never had any issues with the two Pixel phones I've owned so far (Pixel 2XL which I had for 5 years and my current Pixel 7 which I've had for almost 3 years now).  Google's software is what has me hooked on Pixels due to its clean software and consistent updates, it really keeps them running smooth and fluid for years and years. At least in my experience.","google in my opinion just needs to continue to hone in on their hardware. they are my preferred phones, but i always call them out for the things they need to work on. that being said, i never had any issues with the two pixel phones i've owned so far pixel 2xl which i had for 5 years and my current pixel 7 which i've had for almost 3 years now. google's software is what has me hooked on pixels due to its clean software and consistent updates, it really keeps them running smooth and fluid for years and years. at least in my experience."

The Galaxy S6 was the only Samsung smartphone I've ever owned. I remember it having a really good camera for the time and the software was actually pretty snappy for a TouchWiz device. I had it for two years before switching to my beloved Pixel 2XL and I've been team Pixel ever since. I'm now on my 2nd Pixel device and I just can't over how great the software is.,the galaxy s6 was the only samsung smartphone i've ever owned. i remember it having a really good camera for the time and the software was actually pretty snappy for a touchwiz device. i had it for two years before switching to my beloved pixel 2xl and i've been team pixel ever since. i'm now on my 2nd pixel device and i just can't over how great the software is.

"I appreciate you sharing your thoughts on this! I completely understand where you're coming from. I really like what OnePlus is doing with their hardware. I totally agree with you regarding Motorola. They have fantastic hardware but the lack of consistent software updates is really holding them back for me. If the Pixels didn't exist OnePlus would be my number one choice followed closely by Samsung only due to the support. I wish OnePlus phones were fully supported on all US carriers. I prefer the Pixel because of the timely and consistent software support and its clean OS. I've had two Pixel phones so far (my beloved Pixel 2XL and my current Pixel 7) and both of them have remained solid for years. These are the first phones I've owned that I didn't experience any slowdowns whatsoever after years of owning them. The only thing Google really needs to improve on is their hardware.

"Hey my friend, I truly appreciate you sharing your thoughts on this. I've never been an iPhone person but I definitely respect them for what they bring to the table. One of my favorite iPhones of all time is the 8 Plus. I think it's the best of the home button era of iPhones. I also really like the 13 Pro Max, that's easily one of the BEST phones Apple has ever made. It's just a really solid iPhone in all regards. 

Unfortunately I haven't had any experience with Xiaomi, Huawei, or Honor phones since they aren't sold here in the US. I'm a lifelong Android user (my first smartphone was in July 2010) so I've had 2 LG phones (LG Ally 3G, and LG G2) , 2 Motorola phones (Droid Bionic and Droid Razr) , and 1 Samsung phone (Galaxy S6) but since switching to my beloved Google Pixel 2XL back in the day, I've been hooked on Pixel devices. What I loved about Pixel phones is Google's software approach. It's clean, quick, and very well supported. Their hardware isn't as powerful as Samsung or Apple, but MAN the software really shines and it keeps the phone performing beautifully for years and years. I had my Pixel 2 XL for 5 years and it remained flawless the whole time I had it, I now have had my current Pixel 7 since launch and it's still solid almost 3 years later. I love what Google does with their software. They just need to continue to improve their hardware in my opinion.","hey my friend, i truly appreciate you sharing your thoughts on this. i've never been an iphone person but i definitely respect them for what they bring to the table. one of my favorite iphones of all time is the 8 plus. i think it's the best of the home button era of iphones. i also really like the 13 pro max, that's easily one of the best phones apple has ever made. it's just a really solid iphone in all regards. unfortunately i haven't had any experience with xiaomi, huawei, or honor phones since they aren't sold here in the us. i'm a lifelong android user my first smartphone was in july 2010 so i've had 2 lg phones lg ally 3g, and lg g2 , 2 motorola phones droid bionic and droid razr , and 1 samsung phone galaxy s6 but since switching to my beloved google pixel 2xl back in the day, i've been hooked on pixel devices. what i loved about pixel phones is google's software approach. it's clean, quick, and very well supported. their hardware isn't as powerful as samsung or apple, but man the software really shines and it keeps the phone performing beautifully for years and years. i had my pixel 2 xl for 5 years and it remained flawless the whole time i had it, i now have had my current pixel 7 since launch and it's still solid almost 3 years later. i love what google does with their software. they just need to continue to improve their hardware in my opinion."

"That's very fair. I'm a Pixel fan, but I've always called them out for their hardware. They really need to step it up when it comes to the Tensor Chip and the modem. From what I hear, Google is FINALLY ditching Samsung for TSMC to make the Tensor G5 chip. I also hear that Google is moving to MediaTek's flagship modem as well. I'm really hoping this helps the Pixel become more efficient and a little more powerful. I'm honestly not expecting a huge power boost, but I do hope for better efficiency.","that's very fair. i'm a pixel fan, but i've always called them out for their hardware. they really need to step it up when it comes to the tensor chip and the modem. from what i hear, google is finally ditching samsung for tsmc to make the tensor g5 chip. i also hear that google is moving to mediatek's flagship modem as well. i'm really hoping this helps the pixel become more efficient and a little more powerful. i'm honestly not expecting a huge power boost, but i do hope for better efficiency."

I recently moved on from my 2010 Tacoma which I had for almost a little over 15 years. It was trouble free. The only reason I finally got rid of it was because of the axels and wheel joints were too expensive to repair after much wear and tear.  But in terms of the engine and transmission it was bullet proof! I know have a 2021 Tacoma and plan to keep it for a while and trade it in for a Tundra one day hopefully.

"Thank you so much for sharing your thoughts on this, my friend. I'm a lifelong Android user (first smartphone was an LG Ally 3G (Verizon) I got back in the summer 2010 going into my sophomore year of college). I've had 2 LG phones (2nd being the LG G2), 2 Motorola phones (Droid Bionic and Droid Razr) and only 1 Samsung phone (Galaxy S6) but have since settled with Google phones with the first being my beloved Pixel 2XL. So I never had an iPhone as my daily driver. My wife on the other hand is an iPhone user and every time I use it, I can't stand how iOS navigates. I do have a 10th Gen iPad which I like for video streaming, casual games, and the occasional Zoom calls and I have a MacBook that I use for work, but those are the only two Apple products that I have.

That's totally understandable! I've only had one Samsung phone and that was the Galaxy S6 which I had for two years. I really liked the hardware and it had a pretty solid camera (though this has never been my top priority when it comes to phones because I don't take many pictures). The only thing that annoyed me about that phone was the battery life near the end of my time with it was ATROCIOUS. I also grew annoyed with some of the duplicate apps that were unnecessary. I also realize that this was before the OneUI days so I know things are different now. But otherwise it was a pretty good phone. I went from that phone to my beloved Pixel 2XL and I became a Google Pixel fan ever since due to their software. I do like Samsungs hardware though.,that's totally understandable i've only had one samsung phone and that was the galaxy s6 which i had for two years. i really liked the hardware and it had a pretty solid camera though this has never been my top priority when it comes to phones because i don't take many pictures. the only thing that annoyed me about that phone was the battery life near the end of my time with it was atrocious. i also grew annoyed with some of the duplicate apps that were unnecessary. i also realize that this was before the oneui days so i know things are different now. but otherwise it was a pretty good phone. i went from that phone to my beloved pixel 2xl and i became a google pixel fan ever since due to their software. i do like samsungs hardware though.
"No need to apologize at all. I really appreciate you sharing your thoughts on this. I think topics like this need to be discussed and we as consumers need to be honest with these companies. I'm a lifelong Android user and sadly only had 2 LG phones (the LG Ally 3G (Verizon) which was my very first smartphone (July 2010)  and the LG G2 (2014 to early 2015). I really enjoyed those phones. Unfortunately, my G2 was only great for 8 months. The screen calibration went absolutely HAYWIRE to the point it became unusable. I got a replacement G2 and sadly the same thing happened about 3 months in. I was devastated because I really liked that phone. I never went back with LG after that. Afterwards, I went with the Samsung Galaxy S6 which was my only Samsung phone. I had that phone for 2 years before finally settling on Google. The Pixel 2XL was the phone that was responsible for making me a Pixel fan. I had that phone for 5 years and it remained flawless for me all 5 years of owning it. The clean software and frequent and consistent OS updates is what keeps me coming back. I now have the Pixel 7 which I got at launch and almost 3 years later, the OS is still smooth and running well with virtually no hiccups. 

I do wish LG and HTC were still making phones and I wish Sony still sold phones in the US. I never got a chance to try any HTC or Sony phones where they were available. I did have two of the early Motorola phones (Droid Bionic and the OG Droid Razr) though. This was before I was really informed about the larger phone market. Knowing what I know now, I definitely would've went HTC, Sony, and Nexus back in the day.","no need to apologize at all. i really appreciate you sharing your thoughts on this. i think topics like this need to be discussed and we as consumers need to be honest with these companies. i'm a lifelong android user and sadly only had 2 lg phones the lg ally 3g verizon which was my very first smartphone july 2010 and the lg g2 2014 to early 2015. i really enjoyed those phones. unfortunately, my g2 was only great for 8 months. the screen calibration went absolutely haywire to the point it became unusable. i got a replacement g2 and sadly the same thing happened about 3 months in. i was devastated because i really liked that phone. i never went back with lg after that. afterwards, i went with the samsung galaxy s6 which was my only samsung phone. i had that phone for 2 years before finally settling on google. the pixel 2xl was the phone that was responsible for making me a pixel fan. i had that phone for 5 years and it remained flawless for me all 5 years of owning it. the clean software and frequent and consistent os updates is what keeps me coming back. i now have the pixel 7 which i got at launch and almost 3 years later, the os is still smooth and running well with virtually no hiccups. i do wish lg and htc were still making phones and i wish sony still sold phones in the us. i never got a chance to try any htc or sony phones where they were available. i did have two of the early motorola phones droid bionic and the og droid razr though. this was before i was really informed about the larger phone market. knowing what i know now, i definitely would've went htc, sony, and nexus back in the day."

"Uniden R8 tied in with my Samsung S23 Ultra. Only use waze for directions these days. Highway Radar takes the rather thin distance and expands it to whatever you wish. I have mine display markings at 1/2 mile , one mile, 3 miles, 5 miles and ten miles. Waze is limited currently to showing only 1/2 mile out while my detector has gotten up to a 4 mile warning. 
I do keep an R7 in my wife's SUV but will switch them out with my R8 when I'm taking a road trip in her SUV. R7 is good, R8 is just a bit better and that whole Bluetooth to my phone. 

[four mile warning ](https://youtu.be/vzAK8ymfNuM?si=87UtEPXre6ibzgcJ)

Just took my MX-5 on a shot road trip to to get a soda, 60 miles away. Sure, my fridge is stocked and there are plenty of places along the way but it is the 130 mile trip that is more interesting (I like to drive). Plus my mother in law is visiting... Still helped me warn about threats ahead since I generally try to keep around 95 mph avg with both highway radar and my R8 blasting away.

"So when I upgraded from my beloved Pixel 2XL to my current Pixel 7, I originally wanted to go with the 7 Pro, but I decided to go with the regular 7 because of the curved display on the 7 Pro. I'm glad Google has done away with them the last two years. When I upgrade this time, I'm going with Pro XL model, because I want a bigger display this time around.","so when i upgraded from my beloved pixel 2xl to my current pixel 7, i originally wanted to go with the 7 pro, but i decided to go with the regular 7 because of the curved display on the 7 pro. i'm glad google has done away with them the last two years. when i upgrade this time, i'm going with pro xl model, because i want a bigger display this time around."

"I never had an iPhone but I've always wanted to have one as a secondary device just to play around with. My wife has the iPhone 13 and I have the Pixel 7. The only Apple devices I've ever owned were the original iPod touch and my current iPad 10th Gen which I only use for streaming videos, playing casual games, and the occasional Zoom calls.","i never had an iphone but i've always wanted to have one as a secondary device just to play around with. my wife has the iphone 13 and i have the pixel 7. the only apple devices i've ever owned were the original ipod touch and my current ipad 10th gen which i only use for streaming videos, playing casual games, and the occasional zoom calls."
"That's good to hear! Glad it's been great. All Google needs to do is focus more on the power and efficiency of their Tensor chips moving forward and they would be the best phones on the market in my humble opinion. I'm glad they are finally ditching Samsung and going with TSMC for the upcoming Tensor G5 chips. I'm hoping this brings improvement in efficiency, I'm honestly not expecting a huge boost in power though.","that's good to hear glad it's been great. all google needs to do is focus more on the power and efficiency of their tensor chips moving forward and they would be the best phones on the market in my humble opinion. i'm glad they are finally ditching samsung and going with tsmc for the upcoming tensor g5 chips. i'm hoping this brings improvement in efficiency, i'm honestly not expecting a huge boost in power though."

"I completely agree with you on this. My personal preference is Google because I like their software approach. I only wish they stepped it up a bit with their hardware. That being said, I never had a single issue with any of the two Pixel phones I've owned so far. My beloved Pixel 2XL was my first Google phone and the one that made me a fan. I had it for 5 years and it remained flawless performance wise the whole time I had it. I have had my Pixel 7 since launch and the same story. Still rocking along pretty well almost 3 years later. I like how the software remains stable, smooth, and well optimized for years.","i completely agree with you on this. my personal preference is google because i like their software approach. i only wish they stepped it up a bit with their hardware. that being said, i never had a single issue with any of the two pixel phones i've owned so far. my beloved pixel 2xl was my first google phone and the one that made me a fan. i had it for 5 years and it remained flawless performance wise the whole time i had it. i have had my pixel 7 since launch and the same story. still rocking along pretty well almost 3 years later. i like how the software remains stable, smooth, and well optimized for years."

If the Pixel phones didn't exist OnePlus would be my first choice followed closely by the Samsung Galaxy S series phones. I like what OnePlus is doing with their hardware. Did you get your 7 Pro at launch? I really wanted to go with the 7 Pro when it was time for me to upgrade but I want with the regular 7 due to the 7 Pro having a curved display.

"Yeah, around when Android 12 builds were released is when I think they ""merged"" them. That's when OnePlus went down the drain. In my mind the 7 Pro was really the last phone that personified the original OnePlus vision- top tier hardware at a budget price with some nice customizations on Android.","yeah, around when android 12 builds were released is when i think they ""merged"" them. that's when oneplus went down the drain. in my mind the 7 pro was really the last phone that personified the original oneplus vision- top tier hardware at a budget price with some nice customizations on android."
"That's definitely legitimate. I'm a Pixel fanboy but I'm also an objective one. I know Google hasn't done the best with their hardware over the years, though it is getting better, they still have some ways to go. I personally haven't had any issues with either my beloved 2XL or my current 7 but I know many have, especially when it comes to the chipset and the modem. Google really needs to focus more on their hardware. I personally think their software is the best in the business it terms of fluidity and optimization, but their Tensor chips need to step it up with the power and efficiency. I'm glad Google is finally going with TSMC for their upcoming Tensor G5 chip along with a flagship MediaTek modem  for the Pixel 10 series. which really excites me as a Pixel fan. 

Again, I haven't had any issues with overheating on my Pixel 7 and performance has been great for me, but I know Google can definitely do better with their hardware, no question.","that's definitely legitimate. i'm a pixel fanboy but i'm also an objective one. i know google hasn't done the best with their hardware over the years, though it is getting better, they still have some ways to go. i personally haven't had any issues with either my beloved 2xl or my current 7 but i know many have, especially when it comes to the chipset and the modem. google really needs to focus more on their hardware. i personally think their software is the best in the business it terms of fluidity and optimization, but their tensor chips need to step it up with the power and efficiency. i'm glad google is finally going with tsmc for their upcoming tensor g5 chip along with a flagship mediatek modem for the pixel 10 series. which really excites me as a pixel fan. again, i haven't had any issues with overheating on my pixel 7 and performance has been great for me, but i know google can definitely do better with their hardware, no question."

"Although it doesn't keep me from being stupid.

About a month ago, my R8 was going off and I even saw the cop. 54 in a 40 plus I forgot to put the insurance card back in the car. They let me go without a ticket because I have such a perfect record. Perfect, that was the 61st time I've been stopped for speeding but admittedly, that was mostly in my youth.

It even included what might have been insulting ""just take it easy, don't want to be showing the kids a bad example"". All my adult kids drive at it below the speed limit. Example, it took my adult kids 32 hours to drive from their old house to mine (they moved here to be nearer to me). Took me 10 hours less.

"It was a cool phone! It was like a BlackBerry Bold, but Windows based. I really liked it. It had 3G which was before the iPhone 3G came out if I’m not mistaken, but it absolutely ate its battery. But I remember it came with an extended battery in the box, and an extra back cover with a camel hump to fit that bigger battery. Good times.","it was a cool phone it was like a blackberry bold, but windows based. i really liked it. it had 3g which was before the iphone 3g came out if i'm not mistaken, but it absolutely ate its battery. but i remember it came with an extended battery in the box, and an extra back cover with a camel hump to fit that bigger battery. good times."
"Glad it's been rocking along pretty well for you. I'm looking to upgrade either this year to the Pixel 10 Pro XL or wait until next year for the Pixel 11 series. The only reason is because of the hardware. I want to go with a larger display this time around. Plus I want a more efficient chipset and modem. I'm watching what Google does with the Pixel 10 series, I'm really curious to see how a TSMC made Tensor G5 chip along with the rumored MediaTek modem will perform for the Pixel 10 series.","glad it's been rocking along pretty well for you. i'm looking to upgrade either this year to the pixel 10 pro xl or wait until next year for the pixel 11 series. the only reason is because of the hardware. i want to go with a larger display this time around. plus i want a more efficient chipset and modem. i'm watching what google does with the pixel 10 series, i'm really curious to see how a tsmc made tensor g5 chip along with the rumored mediatek modem will perform for the pixel 10 series."
Now it's where Google's AI literally answers the phone for you and asks what you're calling about and the phone will tell you what their response is and you can choose to keep asking them questions via the Google AI to find out more info or you can hang up or answer. Pretty much all spam calls. Just hang up when they hear it and it seems like I don't even get any anymore after a few years of having pixels.

"Not right at launch, but not too long after. I absolutely loved the screen on it. High refresh rate before that became a standard thing and no camera cutout. The popup camera was so cool.

Also, I'm apparently in the minority of actually liking the screen curve.
