Nobu
El Jannah post franchising. Doesn't slap like the glory days
The PR company or restaurant pays the tiktokkers to go. Free meal and maybe cash. It’s been pretty bad in Sydney of late… some pretty average places have done a good job getting some social amplification which definitely isn’t warranted.

Chin Chin. Better off going to cheap and cheerful Thai in Newtown 
That 360 restaurant at Sydney Tower. The food was underwhelming and not worth anything close to the price.
Don’t tell aunty. You can get way better Indian food for less than half the price in Harris park.
"Ho Jiak.

Truffles on instant noodles? Do one."
"Any Merivale joint.


Edit: except Lorraine which no longer exists. That cheesecake was S tier. "
Also Woodcut.
Creating a consistent restaurant experience is really fucking hard - as borne out by the many conflicting comments below and in every other corner of internet food discourse. Stop watching dead shit influencers whose whole existence is predicated on overhyping and selling a highlight reel of their existence and go out and eat the - quite frankly - absurd variety of high quality cuisines that Sydney has to offer and accept that sometimes you’re going to get dud.
"Eljanah, shit food and has gone down hill since they got sold."
Hong Ha
Milky Lane
"Hong Ha, not worth the massive line that when you can go elsewhere and not line up."
"QUAY is the worst of the worst. Spent $750 with no alcohol and EVERYTHING was liquified or jellied, yuck. The confit pig jowl is the jewel in the menu and chef’s favourite and I can’t express how gross it is. 

Some food is so amazing it makes you cry (aka Ormeggio at the Spit). We cried at Quay too… when the bill came."
"This reddit will  eventually have one negative comment for every decent venue in the city, where will we all go?  lol"
"This thread is such a litany of sorrow - makes me almost glad that I’m too dead tired all the time looking after a newborn, to go out for a nice meal."
"Rockpool bar and Grill - it was just really quite average and the worst thing for me is that the worst dishes were the steak (the best was the hiramasa kingfish but frankly, there’s about 35,678 restaurants in Sydney which have the same dish on their menu executed to the same quality). Ordered a cape grim rib eye on the bone rare to medium rare. Got this 1cm thick cooked to medium chunk of sadness. Extremely disappointing.

Honourable mentions Margaret, Mjolner, Peterman"
One more..controversial but have to say it. BL burger. You can shove your blame Canada up your arse. It's like eating sugar.
"Pellegrino 2000 was extremely average 

Didn’t think Bentley was worth the price 

Aria is very average"
Rashays
"Saint Peter - Josh Niland has cultivated an amazing media presence championing the nose to tail approach but i swear every time I’ve been there it just feels like regular well cooked seafood rather than anything fancy with weird parts of the fish 

Bennelong - you’re just paying for the view. Food is just nice produce cooked well but boring and uninspiring"
Firedoor
We have friends that love The Paddington and it’s super popular but it’s pretty underwhelming esp for what you’re paying. Their rotisserie chicken is not worth the hype. I’ve had a few good things there but happy to never go there again.
Omg I said Pellegrino a few weeks ago and everyone downvoted me. So true. It was a major letdown.
Any “fine dining” or “trendy” place in the shire (Cronulla etc) The people around here have no clue what good food is. Just linen pants and lip fillers and style over substance in all these trendy places. Have been to every fancy restaurants locals recommend as amazing and they are absolutely below average. Stick to the city and inner city /eastern suburbs for fine dining is what I’ve learned.
One of the sydney food insta people was actually unironically hyping up IKEA food.
"Margaret. The food is delicious, but they hussle you through. When you're paying all that money, you want to sit and enjoy it."
I found Catalina to be disappointing and overrated. Service was particularly shit.
"Totally agree with Pellegrino 2000. Small serving sizes and large prices. Tasty, but not worth that price."
A’mare. Google reviews can back up my claim.
Firedoor
"The Italian Bowl in Newtown. No idea how it got so popular, it’s extremely mid"
The Italian bowl in Newtown is proper mediocre
You guys can afford to eat out?!
"Lotus. Honestly, not sure how they're surviving. Absolutely terrible food. 


Aria. Just....meh in general. 


Sokyo"
"Palazzo Salata, which is one of the hyped restaurants in the CBD, was super underwhelming — but it’s always more annoying when they’re 90% of the way there instead of being a straight ripoff. The wines were great, entrees were phenomenal, and then the pastas and steak (we were on a set menu with a larger group) were really average! 

Anything by the Bentley Group (Bentley, Monopole, Yellow, King Clarence) is pretty underwhelming for the price too. 

Also, to offer some positive opinion — I think Icebergs continually lives up to the hype and deserves all the prizes it gets (and the right to charge big prices). 

Also, for a mid price lunch that’s genuinely good, check out Kitchen by Mike in the city. $30 for a lunch but it’s worth the extra money compared to $23 for a bowl of wagieslop in a food court"
Icebergs
Lilymu @ parra.
"Passegiata in Charing cross( Randwick )
Absolutely abysmal food with 3 hat prices..avoid like.the plague that has caught corona and sars"
"Sails.

I can overlook mistakes in the kitchen if the customer service is good enough to recover the evening. They badly fucked up my main (duck was overcooked, quite tough) — instead of redoing it, the solution offered was to have the meat cooked further lmao. Had to pay full price too."
"I feel any chains which isn’t fast food (such as pacific concepts, rashrays and whatever groups) tends to go really downhill once a restaurant join these groups and icing on the cake is jacked up prices

I tend to study to see if a restaurant have a second branch (or whatnot) and if is does, I will try and pick the original one…. 

Sans fast food, any restaurants group or with 2 or more branches seems to be pretty inconsistent."
"I’d say Frangos, I had it once and had pretty high expectations coz of all the hype. Got home and they forgot an item, the chicken burger I had was ok but was fairly average. 

Also haven’t tried el jannahs but am thinking will have the same experience. 

Still willing to give it another shot maybe."
Not over hyped or over rated but Damn I miss EST. cant believe they closed the place down :(
"Holy basil, we went to the one in canley and they had very obviously put precooked chicken in our green curry. It came to our table with chicken piece very obviously placed on top of the curry last minute. Other than that, terrible service and inflated pricing with no improvement to back it up. Saddens me because it used to be a favourite of mine."
"Epicurean buffet at The Crown Barangaroo. Feels like I am eating $50-60 buffets at a $100 setting. Also we went for my dad's birthday on a Sunday evening for $135pp....these sneaky bastards charged a ""Sunday surcharge"", which makes it basically $150pp. Also they charged a credit card fee.....what year are we living in now? Do they want my to pay in cheque? Cash? The bill for our table of 11 was more then $1600. I would love to pay them with silver coins."
Have to seriously rate the Malaysian & Chinese Kitchen bottom of Salesforce tower. Best Laksa in Syd-E-Ney
Totti’s
Mamak
"Bennelong. Food was okay but service was absolute rubbish. Felt rushed, backpacker severs couldn't understand clearly enunciated English and we had to ask for the same thing multiple times. The opera house meringue dessert was crap"
Don't tell Aunty
Clare Smyth - Oncore. I usually find reason to slip in something negative about this restaurant all the time but sorry the $750 spent was the only thing I can remember.
Bourke Street bakery. Rubbish.
"Hubert. Nice vibe but the food is overpriced, tiny and average."
KILN
Quay - everything just tasted salty
[deleted]
"Lots of people I know compared Aria to Vue De Monde in Melbourne. It was okay, but I felt a good 60% was riding on the coattails of the view. Wouldn’t go back"
TOTTIS
"Went to Matt Moran's restaurant at the Art Gallery NSW last week and regret it.

Very ordinary food. The beef tartare was inedible, way too thick and smothered in sour cream (to disguise the taste?).

Th fish was dry and tasteless... supposed to be catch of the day but def. frozen. The only good thing was the sauce on the crumbed scallops. Dessert was fine, but its not hard to make creamy sugary things delicious.

And tthey were playing pop music... Walked in to Abba! At the Art Galler? I don't underestimate Abba but it was just in a mix of easy listening pop hits. It seemed really out of place.

The staff were sweet. We gave our server a big tip for having to serve such shitty food and keeping graceful about it, lol.

Overall a waste of (a lot of) money. Would not recommend."
"Firedoor.

Went for my bday last week.

Complete disappointment. Rubbish."
"temasek was not for me at all. very quick service, but the hainanese chicken and nasi lemak both just had very little to them when i went."
Any place that sells ramen 30 dollars a bowl out of a sterile concrete room
"Fire door. 
Super overrated. For the price of the food, it wasn’t out of this world. Don’t get me wrong the food was good but you’re paying $400+ per person. The steak was over $200 and wasn’t the best steak I’ve had. You also had to book several months in advance."
Gelato Messina and Anita.
Botswana butchery.
Tetsuya in CBD
Bastardo and Portegno both were just meh after being hyped to us by numerous friends
Stop using tiktok and Instagram.
"Chiswick in Woollahra. It's so busy you can't hear anything, and the times I've been there they have either messed up our order, run out of their signature dish or a collection of other stuff ups"
"Fat Noodle at the Star.

The menu looks good on paper and I want to like the food, but everytime I gave them the chance it was always just bad tasting food. It disgusts me how its always packed."
"Sokyo. Food perhaps a bit better than average, service was poor and they rushed us. For around $200 a head for a special occasion it wasn't worth it at all.

Went to Nagano in Japan last month and for $50 a head went to this place for a meticulously prepared 8 course meal that was better in every way. Best dollar for dollar meal I've had anywhere.

"Clem’s chicken in Newtown. It is genuinely one of the worst chicken joints I’ve ever been to, yet because it’s on King St in Newtown, it’s worshipped"
"It’s not around anymore, but est was a very average experience for me."
Cucinetta — took my mum there for Mother’s Day and we were both underwhelmed by the food especially given how expensive it was. Service and location were lovely though.
ARIA!!! terrible terrible service
"Dear Sainte Éloise, could’ve been a bad day though."
"Otto

  
The service was lovely but the food was quite unremarkable for the price. I guess you're paying for the location but frankly sitting on pier looking at moored yachts is a bit underwhelming as well."

Oatley Chinese and Malaysian

Theeca in Darlinghurst. It's the epitome of what's wrong with Sydney restaurants 
"Mr Wong.

After hearing such great things about this restaurant, I was really looking forward to trying it. I was so disappointed by the average dim sum dishes at marked up prices. The char siu toothfish was quite unique and perfectly cooked but that's about it."
"Oribu...
hands down the worst dining experience i had in sydney"
Hello Auntie- Vietnamese more upmarket place. I dont find their food better than the cheaper places next to it. maybe their produce is better quality but otherwise not that impressed
"Pellegrino is the most overrated that I've experienced. But Sydney is home to the over hyped restaurant scene. 
It has a serious case if the emperor's new clothes syndrome "
Felix. Not terrible but not amazing for the price. And they brought out all our dishes at once which I really hate. Huberts is much better imo.
Ragazzi
Tottis
"Epicurean actually sucks.

As far as dining experiences go, the food was so mediocre, seafood so not-thawed-properly, I'd rather buy a piece of A5 and some fresh seafood for the money.

The crowd is also pretty questionable. One table had a skinny guy looking like he came straight off a traffic control shift talking to his cousins at such a fast pace, I honestly thought he had one too many cokes."
Outrageously and egregiously paid over $400 for two of us to eat at Restaurant Hubert. And my duck was underdone and sloppy.

Seriously! I cant believe that they have a full DJ playing club music while we are trying to eat out sushi. Like what Japanese restaurant is like that?!
"Your talking about Nobu Sydney, been 3 times invited by a client. Its bog average food. We had 3 tacos for something like $30 the taco was dry and chewy. Doritos fresh from a bag is much better or those coles mexican tacos. I told 2 servers one being a senior saying they cooked it wrong or it wasnt right but they refused to listen and just said thats the way they made it. They didnt even b bother to say they would go back to taste a sample from the kitchen. Any other restaurant would have taken it away and served a fresh meal.

Nobu Perth and melbs is off the hook, cant recommend them enough. 

Sydney is so crap, i actually will give them a 1 star google review once i get around to it"
Plus it's a (fancy) chain. aMare in Crown also gets my vote for terrible place to eat.
"agree! The chicken has seen better days, when it wasn't a dehydrated, overburned twig. Used to be super cheap with a sizeable chunk. I'd still eat the garlic sauce like it was a tub of yogurt though! That shit is still amazing!"
Earlwood el Jannah stays winning
We’ve found inconsistency in the Melbourne branches. On the odd occasion the chicken is delicious and lemony perfection inside and out - next four times it’s just well-above average charcoal chicken.
Ehhh opposite imo. Use to be inconsistent back in the day. Now it's consistently decent as it's all done by particular standards and the dips are all made the same way and sealed.
It was.. better??
Good times
The Burwood one slaps
"Yeah, El Jannah fandom is a good indicator of people not to get food advice from."
"Had a disgusting chicken wrap at the 
Bankstown store drive through. Won't go back"
Oh I was wondering if that would be the case...how sad...
"The dip sucks now, mass produced shit mixed with shit mayo"
"Soooo dry, I think the Blacktown one was the worst one I ever went to"
I agree that the chicken is dry too!
"If youre talking about granville, i find Hawa down the road to be so much better than el jannah."
I wholeheartedly recommend frango as an alternative
Burnt chicken
[removed]
I got blocked by places in Sydney for saying he's just a sellout and he never has any bad reviews bc they all give him incentives
This is pretty standard for all restaurants - they use social media influencers to promote their business and give them a free meal (and cash if the account is big enough).
"I feel like Ito is a victim of this.

Went as a normal person, it was… okay meh kinda bad. My friend and I walked away speechless and don’t talk about that meal anymore"
"yes! I had been starting to suspect this, just has happened like 3x in a row, rave reviews and great content on social media and then meh (or worse) irl"
anywhere that's on placesinsydney and their group friends I simply just don't go
Theeca Surry hills is a place I have never heard of anyone going but is all over TikTok. Feels a bit disingenuous.
"You are dead right about the sameness of menu these days 😂

Michelin guides visit your city/region/country if your tourism board pays Michelin a fee. That’s why we are left out. Which is probably a good thing with all the same menus!"
"Sydney is simply too expensive to take large risks with a menu so you end up seeing the same thing again and again, of course if you venture out to the shadowy lands of the poorly written English menus you can find some great stuff there. 

The dining scene in Sydney is still far too immature, before social media made the world smaller we were a backwater, great ingredients but meh dining culture. In fact dining scene in Sydney is mostly all based on views and hype, there's very few institutions that's got loyal returning diners."
"Chin chin for me too. Food is relatively expensive and not particularly innovative, seating too close together and really noisy. The food is good but no way did it live up to expectations.

I knew the style of food they serve, so not expecting genuine Thai, I just think it’s overrated."
"Yeah I had chin chin in melbourne prior to covid and it was pretty great (late lunch, got great personal attention from the shift manager) - tried sydneys one not long ago and the service was terrible (eg a waitress spilt half a cocktail all over a friends shirt and just said “oops sorry” and walked away - we had to chase down the manager ourselves) music was too loud - food was decent at least"
"Just go to the other side to Haymarket Thai town and you'll be spoilt for choice. Heck just walk less than a block and go to Spice I am, better thai food and less pretentious."
"Yep, was boring when I ate. Another Kingfish sashimi? Errr"
"So overrated. Awful atmosphere, food only tastes half decent because it's loaded with sugar, fat, salt and the wait staff don't have a single clue."
Chin chin was soooo average and upsettingly expensive for mid Thai :(
Totally awful - fast food slap dash with blaring music. Ugh. I live around the corner and used to pop in for just a drink but won’t even don that now.
"Probably because it’s not a Thai restaurant, it’s pan south East Asian"
I fucking love chin chin
"Average food, super rude treatment by staff. At least that was my experience a few years ago. Never went again."
"I haven’t been since all the renos they did a few years back. I liked it previously when you could just go up for a few drinks, haven’t been since it’s became a restaurant."
"Agree, I'd give this place a miss"
I agree! Is this the O bar and dining? They also automatically charge a ridiculous tip/surcharge
I recently went to Chatkazz for the first time and and absolutely loved it. Food was delicious and there was an almost overwhelming amount of choice but everything we ordered was done very well. Service was attentive and helpful.
"Was waiting to see this, holy shit is it overrated. I thought the local Indian takeaway was better"
"A great option for more elevated Indian food is Abhi’s in Concord. It’s hatted I think, and deservingly."
"I think you go here for the fun atmosphere, with passable food."
"yep, most cbd indian is average at best. people don't know what they're missing out on!"
"The town hall shop is the prime offender here (and amah), Haymarket has some specials that are a bit silly but at least leaves the option not to order stupid things like crab on CKT. But yeah, the unnecessary and forced up marketing of what was very good versions of street food is more than a little annoying."
way too expensive even for basic dishes
"They used to be good.. But about a year ago (or was it 2) it changed.

Price hiked up... Quality went down.

Have not been back since."
"At the townhall shop they put unnecessary ingredients that don’t add anything to their dishes but more $$
The Strathfield and Haymarked stores are a bit better, but since about a year or so ago they hiked up their prices and it’s not really worth it anymore. I still think their laksa is really good though. 
My more affordable haunts for Laksa are Malay Chinese at Salesforce tower/Ashfield or Hokkien Gia in Campsie."
"Ho Jiak is pretty good, but not worth the price really :/"
I went there once. All salty no taste. Disappointed :(
Truffles on pasta is a thing..
The Newport is the perfect place to take new to Sydney people and the food is pretty damn good.
I think I'm a basic bitch cause I love Totti's
"I think totti’s is overrated, but if the head chef is Dan Hong the food is always going to be good"
"While I understand the hate towards Justin Hemmes, I've had a lot of good experiences at Merivale restaurants. I would recommend Jimmy's Falafel, Felix and Queen Chow Enmore."
"I feel like it’s become trendy to hate companies like that, but Vic on the park and Jimmy’s Falafel are both great"
Mimi's is amazing
Lorraine’s strawberry mascaporne cake was so gooodd omg
I miss Lorraine’s Mascarpone cake
I won’t take any Jimmy’s Falafel slander
There was a thread here a few weeks ago where everyone was talking about how good merivale is! Glad that taste and sense have prevailed.
"Agreed, but I thought mumu's is great. I am Vietnamese and usually hate white-washed, fusion Asian food but mumu's flavours & texture was fantastic (minus the price obviously)"
Swings and roundabouts. Merivale own local pubs like Allawah Hotel and they have hands down the cheapest and highest quality pub food in the entire St George
We used to buy cakes from Lorraine for co workers when we worked nearby… the good old days
Jimmy’s Falafel is hero
Mimis is yummy
People love to hate a Merivale venue for no apparent reason besides who owns it.
this is hilariously accurate
That cheesecake was the best cake in sydney
Insanely expensive and underwhelming for the price.
[deleted]
Agreed! Food was ok but not worth the price!
"This place is very hit and miss. First time I went I loved it, next time was meh"
"Hate this place.

We rocked up at 5:28pm for a 5:30pm and the front of house made us wait 😂"
[deleted]
This should be top comment.
Owner is a massive Gronk too.
Especially when there are multiple better ones just a few doors down.
💯 worked in the area for years and I actually preferred the others that are further down botany road.
As a banh mi fiend I thought Hong Ha was actually very good but overwhelmingly raw onion tasting. I struggle to find a better overall roll than the Marrickville MPR. But you are spoiled for choice in Sydney and waiting in a queue for hong ha is a mistake.
Melbourne!
"I know ! I wasn’t expecting such an outpouring - but I think, as someone else has commented in this thread - consistency is really hard, so some of these places might be great and just having an off night when the commenters went. Also not every place is going to appeal to every person - as shown by the many conflicting comments in this thread. So there is always hope!! and even if there are some places that are just consistently bad/overhyped, there are sooo many in Sydney that are amazing and meet/exceed the hype :) We really are spoiled."
Restaurants have always been an overrated thing. They don’t genuinely bring people that much joy even when they’re great.
"I used to love Rockpool. One of our vendors took us there for lunch a few months back. Ordered a $90 scotch fillet that was so chewy I threw half the steak out. If I was paying I would have sent back the steak. After that experience I'll never eat steak out again, especially when I can reverse sear 100 times better than most restaurants on my Kamado Joe."
ugh Mjolner! had forgotten about that one hahaha
Melbourne one is pretty shit too
Chunk of sadness hahaha
Feel like the burger hype has died down massively in the last 6 or 7 years. Those “premium” burger places used to be all the rage but seems like they have much less presence now in terms of social media and stuff.
their cheese burger is the bomb tho
It has maple glazed bacon and maple aioli. What did you expect?
I am yet to find a better overall burger than bar Luca and certainly nothing that has given me that wide open mouthed WOW that my first blame Canada gave me. But I agree that it's a sugar bomb and is more of a short term rather than long term thing.
anything solotel and matt moran is underwhelming
Aria sucks hard. Went there via a generous voucher. Had the worst meal and service I can remember. Their sommelier had no clue about their wines and was wearing a plastic watch. Can't believe people will pay 250$ and above for that...
Who is rating Rashays highly?
"My brother was a kitchen hand for a week and left. Majority of their food is freezer food and fried foods that didn't go out were just re-fried and given to the next customer that orders. It was one of their most expensive dishes too, like a seafood platter. It was all just frozen stuff anyone can buy.

So yes, overpriced frozen food."
"Every time I see a Rashays it's empty, so I guess that stacks up."
"100%

Totally underwhelming, especially for the price."
"I agree with Saint Peter but disagree with Bennelong! I’ve always enjoyed the food, love the view, and love when they have live music (eg their Jazz Sundays); for me the three combined make the whole experience worth the cost."
"ooooh, that's a difficult one. I had one of his takeaway burgers in lockdown and it insanely good, and I don't even like burgers!"
Bennelong is superb although the service is bang average for the price.
"For Saint Peter initially I was like wtf are you taking about but realised I have never been there for dinner, which the menu sounds exactly as you describe. 

Their lunch menu is super interesting though, and I really do feel it makes you rethink what you can do with seafood in a fun and tasty way."
"I've been there twice for dinner and both experiences were 100% value for money.

Truly inventive.  The fish ""wellington"" was absolutely amazing.  The service was great.  The venue is a little jewel box that has a buzz because its full. 

His fish butchery is fantastic as well.  Those 'cheeseburgers' rock."
"With the caveat that I haven’t been for a couple of years, HARD disagree on St Peter - the swordfish steak and tuna n’duja are both still among my top 10 seafood dishes … unless they’ve gone downhill or people are ordering a snapper fillet and expecting something transformative, I can’t understand the hating …"
It’s probably a bit over hyped from Netflix but personally we had an amazing experience there.
"Yeah, it has really jumped the shark. Spent $600 for two, a relatively uninspiring meal served by wait staff that just seemed a bit “off”, terribly mistiming the dishes and matching wines."
100%.  $185 to access what you’ve actually come for (the steak) is just taking the piss.
"100% this. Also, the lighting is way too bright to the point that it’s off putting. I assume they do that for the chefs benefit but bloody hell"
We waited forever to get in and then I was so disappointed.
"Agree. Nice enough food but nothing memorable. We also found the service super rushed, and we’re not slow eaters!"
[deleted]
Bobby’s just cropped up there it’s pretty good
I'd hype Daim pie 👀
I’ve been here 5-6 times and I haven’t really felt that. We really enjoy our time and I think it’s one of the best restaurants in sydney. Service is impeccable and the food is always amazing.
"Ahh this has been on my list - good to know, seems to be mentioned a couple of times in here."
Was there about 6 months ago with a table of 15 - didn’t feel rushed (but there was not another seating after us) and was delighted we could order al a carte (have had way too many disappointing set menus due to large group size over the years)
Didn’t get that vibe at all. The meal and experience was wonderful.
"I was looking for this comment.  This has to be my #1 over-rated restaurant in Sydney.

Its full, expensive, noisy as hell (which is crazy cos a lot of old folks are there) and every time I go (my in laws love it) I always think the food is fine but it isn't really worth it."
Yeah Catalina is for rich Rose Bay grandmothers who can’t taste anything through their denture toothpaste. No good. Avoid
It was great last time I went there in 2003!
"I've been twice, and food is always great, as for  prices point, it's not as expensive as most fine dining  (3 course $150 is pretty good these days)"
"glad it wasn’t just me!! was feeling a bit like the odd one out with all the rave reviews. When we went everything was under-seasoned, and the pasta was undercooked :( I prefer al dente, but this was crunchy to the point of being near inedible 😭 
The bar staff and FOH were great though to their credit - and the yuzu sgroppino was yummm"
It's the drizzling shits.
Lotus at Barangaroo is great and I’m Chinese
"I thought Lotus at Barangaroo was excellent when I ate there a few years back.

Love Sokyo too but it's pricey."
Sokyo used to be excellent but haven’t been since they had a shake up with the chefs years ago
"Agreed,  Kitchen by Mike is my go to work lunch venue for anyone with dietary requests. The food is tasty, fresh and the salads are actually exciting."
"Kitchen by Mike is everything wrong with the Sydney food scene. It’s not bad food in if itself, but the idea of charging what they charge for pre-prepared canteen style food."
I had the same experience. The pasta and steak was meh.
Second this. Trying to be something it’s not
"Yeah went here recently with family. It’s been my in-laws favourite restaurant for over 20 years. They dine here at least 1-2 times a year. 

They were so disappointed by the food and service the last time we went. I believe it’s had new owners/management. 

The new decor was nice but nothing special. Service was ok but not great. A few mistakes and timing errors which could have been forgiven if the food was better. Entrees and dessert were fabulous but mains were pretty average or one dimensional."
"went there for the first time a few months ago and they gave us an awful table, service was just strange & one of our waiters seemed extremely off putting , and very overpriced drinks. was excited to go beforehand so i felt quite sad after"
"Save yourself the money, don’t buy into the EJ hype. I tried it because everybody raves about it but found it to be overcooked and overpriced crap. If that’s the standard for ‘good’, I should open up a Charcoal chicken."
Yeah I don't understand the Frango's hype either. And I had El Jannah once... the chicken was dry and it was just super average. Apparently people just go there for the garlic sauce but I can't digest garlic so there's no point. Also I'm sure I could make my own garlic sauce and better chicken to go along with it.
"I ate there once, not surprised it closed down"
Their rotis are still the best in my opinion
I went there once and it gave me food poisoning
Mamak in Parra
"I'm from Perth. First time I've been to Sydney was in 2011 as a tourist. I remember lining up there with family not knowing anything about it and we walked away after seeing the eye-watering prices. I visited Sydney last Feb and finally got the chance and the money to eat there. I think the roti is fantastic, but whenever I read about Mamak here on Reddit, it seems that the locals just fatigued on the place. What did I miss about Mamak for over 13 years that it's gotten this commentary now?"
Completely agree. Went there a couple months ago. They lean heavily on ‘it’s the opera house!’ and charge insane prices for what it is. The fact that it’s not too far off Quay pricing blows my mind.
"Yeah, I don’t see a lot of hype for it though."
I mean if I was paying that much for food it would be practically impossible for it to meet my expectations.
I disagree. Oncore is an experience.   It’s miles above similarly hyped places. Yes you pay but it seems genuinely world class. Not parochial
I’d say Oncore is the best fine dining experience in Sydney
"Yeah I think it’s the classic 3 Michelin star French fine dining that is nice but feels so boring (and the service TOO attentive to the point of feeling overbearing) 

The view is spectacular though"
I like the ginger brûlée tart
Ginger brulee tart. Just get that. I don't go there for anything else.
I think their sourdough is among the best
"Yeah had a croissant from there - cold, small and just stale"
"Ugh the pies had the worst pastry, filling was quite acceptable though"
"Before they franchised, they were fantastic. Now they're like any other random cafe with average pastries at best"
Oooh I have to disagree ! I love their almond croissant - sooo much frangipane filling
"The happy hour menu is fantastic though. Cheap cocktails, snacks and mains with live jazz in the background makes it a winner."
My only complaint here is the long wait times to get a table.
The banquet is expensive but it is an insane amount of food
They call me hubie doe 🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥
"Yeah I really feel Hubert has taken a dive of late. 3 years ago it was fantastic, now it just feels like a place for instagrammers."
Why wouldn't you want to pay $10 for a single Jatz? /s
What did t you like about kiln? I’ve been 5 times now and can’t get enough!
Interesting. Been on the list for years. Could just never afford it.
"On my visit there, one of the courses was a crumpet which they announced ostentatiously as if it was a totally amazing new dish they invented from scratch. Hey it was quite the delicious crumpet, but...it's still a crumpet."
Same I am a little disappointed
Nandos? 😂
Yeah the Betty’s Burger thing I can’t wrap my head around. So average and ridiculously over priced. But yet the they are packed every day
Nandos is better than the dry chickens at El Jannah’s.
If we going fast food I will add Guzman Gomez. Burritos are just ball of flavourless rice and anything else I have tried has been thoroughly underwhelming
Sour cream on steak tartare. Holy Mary and Joseph and the baby donkey! No.
That laksa slaps tho
Won’t hear a bad word about Messina.
"+1 for Messina. Gelatissimo is so much better for gelato. Messina is ordinary, but a couple notches above soft serves.

And why name it Messina of all places in Sicily/Italy? Messina as a city is famous for its granita on brioche, not its gelato!"
Agree. Like it’s very nice but not worth the crazy prices
"I've been here twice and food was amazing both times, maybe it's what you ordered??"
"I liked this restaurant, only been fie a Saturday lunch, it was relaxed but food was great produce done well"
Youre tripping. Clems is great. The potato bake and garlic potato balls are fantastic
"I used to say the same then when I lived in Newtown I bought into the hype more an more, I find clems really shines with the sides, chicken schnitzel an fried chicken slap too"
It's horrendous. Probably the worst place I've been to on my culinary adventures
Everything is so salty
"So hit and miss, got terrible food poisoning once"
"Agree been twice over the years. First time terrible, 2nd time much better but still just ok. And it was paid for by my employer at the time so cost me nothing."
Ragazzi was tremendous. Great pasta!
Those questionable crowd and crown are a match in heaven….
"KFC isn’t food; but they don’t care, they love it"
"This I disagree, always full after the 4 hour sitting but not stuffed. Floor staff are great - last time four of them came out, and right at the entrance of the dining floor, after realising our previous course hasn't yet been cleared, they all did an about turn and went back into the kitchen. That's good training right there."
"One of my all time favourites in Sydney. 

Definitely disagree!"
All the comments under this have put Tetsuyas on the list for me!
"A ""hip"" Japanese restaurant.  You think that's weird, try Hakkasan, which is a shitty Chinese restaurant slash nightclub and you can easily drop $300 a head on mediocre yum cha."
"Tables next to us dressed in tracksuit pants running to the bathroom every 10 mins, staff that couldn't give a shit and paying top dollar on top of it all... I've had equally good Japanese elsewhere."
Yes Nobu Sydney! I have heard good things about other locations. It's a shame because I'm reluctant to try them now.
Agreed amare is crap
The garlic dip at Aldi is good enough that I don’t have to go there to eat that sorry chicken just for the dip. 
Oh yes. It was awesome. Now it is dry and disappointing. 
"I knew El Jannah would be the top response before I opened this post.

I don’t know how long ago the “before times” people are referring to. I first had it in Granville 12-13 years ago and couldn’t understand why everyone was going crazy for this overcooked chalky textured chicken with garlic sauce. I’ve had it at their other locations since friends insist on going, and same conclusion. Even Woolies doesn’t overcook their chicken as badly as these guys."
"YES! So obvious it's hyped up and freebies when here all the foodie influencers I follow start shilling the same places in the same week. Their reviews are all annoyingly cutesy and cookie cutter (I mean, who honestly 'cheers' a dumpling?). I unfollowed most of them too."
What tipped me over the edge is when they promoted fucking KFC and maccas specials lol
Heard from insider that they paid around $2k for a particular “blogger” to come and “review” their food.
I thought Sydney food boy was ok? Still seems pretty low key and more about finding places out West hipsters are too scared to go and try.
[removed]
"It’s not the standard for all restaurants. Not everyone is chasing negative growth. There still some people growing venues organically. While it is rare, these places still exist. Doing the whole influencer bit is actually so detrimental to business but only industry professionals are aware of this. You can really tell who was around pre influencer times"
"Went to ito on the weekend having not heard any of the reviews, and it was quite nice imo, but perhaps not worth the price"
Amen brutha. Fucking annoying place.
Had same experience in Sydney - great before covid. Dismal after
I looooove spice I am
Agreed. OG Chat Thai is still a flavour explosion.
Staff are obnoxious rude lil fucks
The Sydney chin chin us awful...needed to be left in Melbourne only where they know what they are doing
Should be Infinity as O Bar is not in Sydney Tower
I also really liked Masala Theory in Surry Hills for more “elevated” indian and a fun atmosphere
"Yeah absolutely this. I didn't think it was ever a foodie destination, it's a friend's birthday let's get loose destination."
"Pista house in Surry hills is okay for a fill after a few drinks, but yeah."
"Very true! I used to go (and order from) there a lot but stopped around COVID time. Prices went up even more, quality went down, too much salt, etc."
Love it
The pizzas and other brunch dishes were average but the entire outdoor area and the view down the cliff is sooo nice that I can put up with the average food and visit there repeatedly.
"My first ever night in Sydney, we went to Thai Potong."
"Got to look at Newport in the context of being a pub. I think across the board the Merivale pubs all seem generally pretty nice even if they have that strangely indistinct Merivale “feel” about them. I like the Collaroy too, great views from that second storey over the beach."
I feel like Tottis is quite affordable with good vibes. I think it’s reputation as the place to brag you’re at on social media can make it seem overated
My canto partner hates Mr Wong with a passion. 
Tottis is awesome value considering the quality and taste of the food. I rate it.
"Was there for work dinner, not bad if someone else is paying the bill. But I felt it was way too loud. On the plus side, I noticed all the wait staff look like models"
Gonna be pedantic here and point out Dan Hong isn’t the head chef at any of these restaurants - he’s the exec chef. The head chefs and sous at each venue do the vast majority of the menu development. Dan Hong just has his name attached to it.
Vic on the park was fine before merivale bought it. All they’ve done is crank up the food prices and put in a few more seats out the back to squeeze in more eastern suburbs kids pretending to be inner west starving artists
[deleted]
Not to mention the terrible service. We had to ask for menus after waiting for 20 minutes 😂
"Some people havnt worked hospo and it shows. Others are just too self centred to give a shit. It’s the same kind of people that, upon the misfortune of attending an understaffed establishment will leave a google review like “they told us the wait would be 30 minutes…. We waited 42 and then they forgot our extra aioli on the side. 1 star…”"
i believe you but may i ask how so?
And the rats don't help
Ha haha touche!
"Upvote for the KJ, use mine about 3 times a week. I’ll take the challenge against any of their $100 steaks. 
For $50 I can feed the family with a big, good quality Tomahawk steak."
How do you reverse sear in a charcoal egg?  Don’t you need low temp for the initial cook then screamingly hot temp for the sear?
For anyone I’ve spoken to about Mjolner (incl. myself) the food itself is only ever a footnote to the theatre of the place. It’s unabashedly a theme park restaurant and it executes everything well enough to be entertaining as a one-and-done experience.
"Omg nooo I can’t agree. My favourite restaurant is Mjolner. We happily pay $400+ because the food is always incredible. My partner and I have all our anniversary dinners there and everyone working in the restaurant always signs a card and congratulates us. It’s a sentimental place for us so maybe I’m biased, but we’ve been going there for 4 years and have basically tried the whole menu now and I’ve never been able to fault it"
That’s because most of them are no good :(
What does their watch have to do with anything?
Fair enough about sommelier’s knowledge. Comment on the personal items staff wear is just snobby.
Fools
Hahaha 
"I guess I always just assumed that? Rashay’s whole thing was being like a cheap family restaurant. Unless they’ve rebranded in the last few years, they were very much a “$10 steak” kind of place."
Yeah I had the sea urchin crumpets for brunch and that was the most interesting thing I’ve had there. Both dinners have been relatively boring fish with acidic dressing/sauce
I was interested in visiting Firedoor *until* I saw the Netflix show and the Bourdain episode in Spain
just pop down to colesworth and get 3 full ones!
Yep. And they do this shared steak situation and it’s 260. I’ve never felt more ripped off in my life.
"So average! We went there with high expectations. It wasn’t as bad as sea level but everything quite underwhelming. Except all the linen pants and lip fillers. Those were overwhelming. 

Recently ate at Ramsgate beach house and was pleasantly surprised by that though. Had low expectations. All the food exceeded them. Not super fancy or anything but food was good!"
"I should have clarified: the IKEA canteen food, not even their imported food."
"Bar staff are good for sure, they’re were the highlight of the meal."
"Lotus at Galeries scarred me too much to even try any of their other franchises. 


Chinese food cooked by people who have no idea what Chinese food is supposed to taste like. And it's pricey. "
First few years of Sokyo were so different to what they are later. After Chase Kojima left it was just terrible.
"I guess we disagree on this — sure it’s pre-prepared, but it’s prepared that day, they’re using good ingredients and the execution is pretty fantastic. Worth the coin IMO"
"Yep that was my experience, about a year ago. I was hoping this was a one off and someone would disagree with me on this (as I’ve seen on other comments) … but looks like its best days are well behind it."
sorry to hear … So guess this place is just shit then
"Tell me when you do. Meanwhile, where can I get good charcoal chicken cos it’s so difficult to find one nowadays."
You definitely did not eat there than.
"I always buy frozen roti from asian supermarket, i don’t remember the brand but the packaging is green in colour. It’s usually fluffy and crispy. Sometimes I feel like it’s better than the quality in Msia BUT I couldn’t get nice dahl sambal or kari ikan here to go with my roti."
"Yeah, I think so too. The queue is offputting, but their roti is still the fluffiest."
Have you been to Malaysia/Singapore/Indonesia?
"Yep I had the same for the one in Haymarket, never been again. But my friends say the other ones are good??"
"It's mostly that for Malaysian food in Sydney, it's pretty average. There are so many options for excellent Malaysian around Sydney these days, and a lot of them are so much better than Mamak, which has coasted on its reputation for too long. Maybe back in the day people didn't know as much about Malaysian food and there weren't as many around, so Mamak had the uniqueness factor going for it"
Maybe I’m just older and cynical now but Oncore’s menu and this “experience” fine dining feels a bit out of fashion like something from 15-20 years ago.
"Yes an experience, for me negative, but I’m glad yours was positive."
"Their 'famous' sausage roll is the biggest disappojntment. Carrots belong in a cake, not a sausage roll."
"This and also the horrible service, especially when go during happy hour"
That’s not very fair - it comes with butter!
The only good Betty’s I found is at Bryon Bay. All those in Sydney are greasy trash
It was disgusting. I didn't eat it.
i have heard people say this so i'll have to give it a go when i go back!
Absolutely !!
"Possibly but we ordered a bit of everything, got the $200 steak to share, the chicken and a few other things too. I think the most disappointing was the steak that was so over priced for what we got.

Bastardo wasn’t terrible but just over hyped, all the pastas tasted similar and were not Al dente. Maybe just an off night for each restaurant. 

Might have to give them a second chance now though"
The place stinks of cheap perfume and deodorant
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Lmao I meant this as a joke 😂
"I also disagree, one of my best Sydney dining experiences"
">tracksuit pants running to the bathroom every 10 mins

The sashimi is off

/s"
"you do know you can just buy the dip by itself, right?"
Agreed - the  Aldi garlic dip is really good.
"I wish you didn’t tell me this. Now I’m jealous. Cause I’ve been loving it last couple years, there’s 2 close to me."
He doesn’t even disclose his ads
"His bad grammar puts me off so much, like when he says chef kiss..."
Who is this?
"I didn't say it was positive, just that it was common. My other half works in restaurant PR / social media so had a bit of exposure to that game.

If it's done well, it can be hugely beneficial to a business but mostly it's pretty ineffective and generates mistrust, as seen in this thread."
I like how this relates to the post you replied to
Yeah I don’t mind Totti’s
"I have a moral duty to push back on this. They will skin you alive for a piece of their dumb focaccia and a couple of slices of prosciutto. Or some normal burrata. And if you really want a glass of wine... Well, I guess that's gotta be at least a hundred bucks. 

Food Is literally not processed. Went a couple of times for the vibes but cannot stand the ridiculous pricing and won't be going back."
"I agree - I don’t mind Tottis, but it isn’t anything crazy and for sure over-hyped."
"Why’s that? I’m sure their opinions are valid but I’m interested to hear. if you want real canto food you go to the burbs, but I’m Chinese and think Mr Wongs is great for what it is; I don’t think they’re pretending to be an ‘authentic’ experience, it’s definitely elevated Australian/Chinese cuisine but the dishes are always well executed. I don’t go often because of the price 😂"
"I’m Cantonese and only like the dim sum and dessert at Mr Wong’s.

The main course (fried rice etc) is just offensive."
The best upscale dining for Cantonese food is Pearl. Preorder their duck the guy they have on staff is a literal duck master
I had the worst experience at a restaurant in my life at Mr Wong
And i agree with passion
"Exec chef isn’t a ‘just has their name attached’, like they are a franchise. They R&D the dishes, design the menus & often the ambience of the venue. They select the vendors for ingredients and then manage staff. It’s not ‘just a name’."
I mean at least they got to copy/paste the Vic formula on the Alex...
"You can still get it at Rockpool Bar and Grill. Lorraine worked for Neil Perry back in the day. 

https://www.sevenrooms.com/experiences/rockpoolbargrillsydney/celebration-cakes--8295559956"
"Yes i thought service was not good, many of the staff seemed quite rude and stuck up. The lady at the desk was very rude and unfriendly"
"It's the best thing I've ever bought, my wife took some convincing but all I hear now is ""this is the best ever..."""
"Usually get it to 225 with deflectors plates, and it takes around 30-40mins to get to 105F/40C internal meat temp.  You then take them off,  then take deflector plates off, lower the grill grates, open vents and get the heat gets up to 350C quite quickly. Seer for 30-45secs each side and bobs your uncle."
I considered whether including that detail or not. I think it deserves its place. A high end restaurant deserves an appropriate attire. It's not a goodonyamate for your Disney Watch tipe of situation. He was sloppy both in his competence and in his attire.
What did you think of the charcuterie?
Even go around the corner to a charcoal chicken store and you pay less or just about the same for a proper cooked chook!
Knew restaurant opening in shire called Fior. Promise it’ll be better than everything else Down there!
To be fair my wife is Chinese and she loves Lotus at Barangaroo.
"I have to say we went in July and loved sokyo, everything was divine loved the cocktails, didnt love the $600 bill tho"
"haha i guess so. i’ll never forget the reaction from the waiter when at the end of our meal i asked him to take a photo of my friend and i sitting at our table (she lives outside of sydney and since we had this place booked months beforehand we wanted a nice photo). he looked at me like i’d asked for some massive favour and that he this was now hard labour. took exactly one photo on my phone and immediately handed it back, sighed aloud and walked off. it wasn’t like they were busy or we’d already been asking for lots"
"I either use local Lebanese run joints if I’m feeling lazy, which are usually slightly better than the franchises but FAR cheaper, or I do it myself. Super quick, cheap and easy to butterfly and season a whole free range chicken."
Yeah ok champ
"I’m Malaysian mate

Mamak does the best fresh ones in Sydney"
Cannot just fly there every time when you only want some rotis.  All other roti places use frozen roti which is a cardinal sin.  Is there any better alternative to Mamak in Sydney in terms of roti?
There are others? Wow ...
I totally agree. I found it a bit dated but not in a nostalgic way. It was fine but not a life changing experience.
I can walk to Aldi. 
English is most likely his second language. Saying you don't like him as a food blogger is one thing but calling out errors in his English/grammar etc is another. That's not very nice.
"In my opinion, ‘the if done well’ part doesn’t really exist anymore. Worked at the start but now statistically google reviews is the most used tool when researching places you haven’t visited previously. People have forgotten how businesses were built prior to social media."
Went there once and asked for a recommendation for an easy going/affordable bottle of red because the wine list is about 60 pages. Guy recommended two that were both over $300 a bottle. We went with the only bottle they had that was under $100 which you can get an Uncle Dan’s for $30… pretentious fucking wankers.
"Not the original poster. 


For me, it's like eating an essay. So, perfectly executed, common Chinese food. But not interesting overall. 


And also, NO WAY would I ever take my parents there. Especially my dad. He will throw a fit. 


""This much money for SALT PEPPER TOFU? And 乾扁四季豆？？”


Yeah.....I value my life. "
"He said it was an overpriced minuscule meh fried rice.


He did love the fried ice cream though. "
"Not OP but it's super ordinary food in a nice setting. Sure if a business partner is footing the bill it's great, but no way I'm paying their prices for that kind of food. It's good, but not enough to warrant what they charge. Def prefer the restaurants in beverley Hills say"
"He hated the fried rice and liked the deep fried ice cream, lol"
"In many cases yes - in Dan Hong’s case…. no. He definitely does not do those things. 

Edited to elaborate:
R&D and menu design is largely done by the individual teams in venue, with some feedback and occasional pointers from Dan. 

The ambience comes from Justin and Bettina Hemmes, as well as their in house styling teams and the architecture firms they hire for venue openings. 

I by no means mean to say it’s a name attached like a franchise, just that he gets a lot more credit than (in my opinion) is deserved. He absolutely mentors some of the chefs as they work their way up the ranks, but he is certainly not hands on full time in all of those venues. Merivale knows full well if they slap his name on a new venue then it is guaranteed to be a draw card. 

Reference: was a manager at one of his restaurants for several years."
Same. Wife wasn’t impressed with the upfront cost for “a BBQ” but now I hear zero complaints. Worth every dollar.
Good to know - if it does a good reverse sear then I might have to pull the trigger ….
"So, write to the owners demanding the sommelier receive a luxury watch as bonus for Christmas."
Ffs *new. Thanks apple
Did you ever open? How’s it going?
"Well, then they need to do something about their consistency."
"Nice. I’ll look into that. As for doing it myself, it’s far too much work for one person dinner 😂 Also, using an oven (the only option i have) is definitely different from charcoal. I used to get it from Naji’s Arncliffe but the quality, just like EJ, has gone down."
Taste buds are no good. Must be a smoker ?
"Fellow Malaysian here, and I concur"
"Agreed, their roti is the best!
The only complaint I hear from some friends/family is that their curries are too spicy (admittedly the people who have said this have low spice tolerance)"
Well said
"Google maps tells me there are 4. My friends are from the north, so I assume they're raving about the Chatswood one. So no clue on the others for their food poisoning stats so far!"
Agree on the price!
"Hey, thanks for elaborating! That is interesting to hear as I know the hierarchies of duties are going to vary from venue to venue and Merivale is a beast unto itself. I’ll happily concede to not knowing what I don’t know and defer to your experience, but at the end of the day as a consumer I’ve still had more hits than misses at Hong’s restaurants, I know he’s obviously not hand making my noodles on the line but even if he is at the point in his career where he’s putting his name to a venue and selecting the team to carry out a vision then he is still selecting good teams and building the quality of his brand.

It will be interesting to see what his chefs do when they inevitably break off and pursue their own ventures"
"We got a refund for that dinner. The waitress was sick (sniffling) and handling our cutlery with her bare hands. It was the beginning of COVID, right before the lockdown. We went into a paranoia trip ahah

I think to deserve the watch he should first demonstrate some serious skills. After that, he needs one badly, so I concur!"
😂done. We will try your new restaurant for sure! Always keen to keep trying new places.
"they served me overcooked pasta and corked wine. The sommelier wanted to argue with me over the wine, so I insisted he fetch another bottle (which I told him I was prepared to pay for if I were proven wrong), and guess what?  Send me another downvote, you knob. Personally, I did not enjoy my dining experience at Est (and neither did my wife)."
