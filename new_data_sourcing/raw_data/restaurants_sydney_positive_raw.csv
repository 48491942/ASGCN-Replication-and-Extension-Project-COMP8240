I recently had a very nice dinner at Bon Vin in Surry Hills. It was $250 for three courses and one set of paired wines.
"The gidley is amazing, great food, great drinks and lovely atmosphere. Right around your budget"
"Heaps, like literally 80% of places you can have an amazing time for less than 350 for two. 

- ragazzi 
- poly 
- Bella Brutta 
- mr Wong
- tottis 

Some of my favs"
"I’m a huge fan of Hubert. Reasonably priced, nice atmosphere and good food (get the tartare)."
"Try this list:

[https://www.goodfood.com.au/eat-out/good-food-guides/good-food-guide-2022-full-list-of-nsw-restaurants-20211124-h1zyl5](https://www.goodfood.com.au/eat-out/good-food-guides/good-food-guide-2022-full-list-of-nsw-restaurants-20211124-h1zyl5)

you will need to go through and discard the really expensive ones.  As a general rule, if it's on the harbour, it's expensive.

Pott's point and Surry Hills is more of a middle ground.  Redfern, Newtown, Glebe are cheaper.

But that's a general rule, rather than hard and fast."
Nomad in Surry Hills
Bar Vincent in Darlinghurst. Fantastic Italian food! Cosy neighbourhood vibe.
"Go to the Gidley. Price is around $300-$400 including wine. Best steak in Sydney, ambience is amazing and service is second to none"
"I really like dining in the bar area at Rockpool bar and grill.

You can either sit at the bar which I think is awesome even if you’re on a date since you get extra special attention from the friendly bartenders  or they have seating too.

The bar menu is excellent and you can order anything from the restaurant too! Plus you can ask for the main courses to be split in two.

My usual order is:
Empanadas
Prawn cutlet
Main pasta dish split in two.
2 x steak Dianne(actually the most underrated steak in Sydney imo) or steak chimichuri from the bar menu OR ribeye from the grill to share.
Side of butter lettuce, fat chips and wagyu gravy
Dessert to share

Wine: their list is huge and extensive and you will find something in your price range, they’ve been known for one of the biggest private wine collections before and their sommeliers are excellent. Having said that if you wanna go the same old Barossa Shiraz route you’re gonna pay for it but the menu has plenty of hidden affordable gems if you chat to the somms. Had an incredible 10 year old German Riesling for $80 there a few months ago.

I do that menu with my wife frequently and comes to around $220~.

This imo is how you do restaurants(as someone who has worked in hospo for 15 years), little bit of this and that from each menu. And it’s a good amount of food.

Also don’t be scared to sit at the bar and get friendly with the staff, I think it really elevates your experience.

Good luck and have fun!"
"China Doll for modern Chinese (Woolloomooloo)
Kitchen by Mike does shared dishes (CBD)

I haven't been but have heard good things about Poly in Surry Hills"
Kindred in surry hills. Mate is part of it. Top notch food. Need to book in advance tho! For a full tasting menu for 2 (like 6 courses or so) with lots o mf cocktails and a $30 tip it was $265
"Automata in Chippendale, $200+ for extended menu  
Sokyo in Pyrmont"
"Kindred does an awesomely priced tasting menu, easily within the budget."
Ester has great food and fits the bill price wise

"Queen chow on Enmore road is great dim sum. Great interiors and good service. Then walk around king st / enmore rd shops - best shops in Sydney. 

+ drop into Black Star pastry.

Cafe Sydney = best view of harbour bridge / opera house.

Icebergs dining room."
Cuisine preference? Dietary requirements?
Arthur Surry Hills - my favourite!
Restaurant Hubert near Wynyard! They do live jazz every day too! It’s a really nice vibe :)
KINDRED Restaurant on Cleveland St is my my absolute favourite. Price is extremely reasonable for two!
"Agree with most suggestions, especially Hubert. I’d add the Chop House - I’ve not been there in ages and it was surprisingly excellent. Food was superb. Service was wonderful. Have the brussel sprouts - they are amazing."
"Cafe Paci Newtown. Hits the price point, service is amazing, food and wine absolutely delicious."
"Nomad, Yulli’s, Calle Rey, Nel"
"Mr Wong’s I highly recommend it, not sure if you will get a booking though. Hope you enjoy your time in Sydney"
"I'm just rolling through the responses, making a lot of notes, seeing how much people care about local eats and upvoting the hell out of all you beautiful, passionate people."
"Try Sails on Lavendar bay.  Great food and view!  You can get the ferry from Circular Quay.

Do you want a view? Do you have cuisine preferences? Do you want to share or have your own meals?
The burgers are better at hungry jacks!
"For something, somewhere unusual Bopp Tone Sydney, The Winery Surry Hills  Employees Only Sydney, Misfits Redfern, all of these come with eclectic decor, amazing service, awesome cocktail and wine lists and the food is delicious!"
[Macleay St Bistro](https://macleaystbistro.com.au/)
"Tapa vino’s!
BEST wine list and great tapas."
(O Bar and Dining) and (Nomad) are both around that price range.
Try Bar Totti’s a few locations amazing food and atmosphere.
The Butler in potts point
"There’s a website called Concrete Playground that lists heaps of things to do in Sydney including restaurants and they sort by price too

[Website](https://concreteplayground.com/sydney/)"
Bar Tottis in the city is great
"Ho Jiak Town Hall, smores in castlecrag"
My go to used to be Century 21 but covid ended it. I believe all the chef's have moved to another restaurant but haven't been able to find it.
Figo Restaurant & Bar - beautiful Italian food
"Kindred in Darlington (Italian) - 
Hugo’s Manly (Australian/mix of everything) - Otto Wooolloomooloo ( Italian) - 
Sake Manly or The Rocks (Japanese)"
Nobu @Barangaroo Crown Casino has a great Omakase set menu for c.$180pp
"Lumi Dining with their set menus is great!

Also like the .Nel dining."
"Bistro St Jacques in Redfern is spectacular.

Pino's Vino E Cucina in Alexandria is also fantastic

Both would sit in that 250 for 2 range

La Ricetta in Enmore would be a little bit less but it's just as wonderful"
"Mjølner in Redfern is fantastic. Nordic food and drink. Fancy but laid back, and definitely not 500 pp"
"Cho cho San , nomad , Hubert are my favs"
Catalina. Food and service both excellent.
I loved Nour in Surry Hills.
One Penny Red in Summer Hill is really great
Kaffir lime is always one I recommend. Good quality thai food
"I second this recommendation, a French friend of mine says it's her favourite French place in Sydney and I'd agree. It's affordable for what it is, and I've never had a bad meal there. Duck ravioli is particularly amazing but everything else is great too"
Seconding. I went for a friend's birthday and it was great.
One of my favourite places and I second the duck ravioli - it’s amazing
Ploos at The Rocks. You get the full harbour view with excellent food.
Upvote for Mr Wong. I'm also a fan of Cafe Sydney at Customs House.
"And their sister restaurant Bistro 916.

Also Dear Saint Eloise nearby is great too which is sister restaurant of Ragazzi.

Like theres so many good $100pp range restaurants in Sydney"
Hubert is fantastic
"I went to Hubert early this year. The beef tartare, and the bread and butter with some of the XO sauce from the escargot is great. I wrote a [review of Hubert](https://pegfeeds.com/2022/05/11/restaurant-hubert-sydney-nsw-restaurant-review/) and put some dimly lit photos on my site."
"$250-$350 is a great budget in sydney.

If I could i would trek it to castlecrag and dine at Smores, but might be unrealistic for tourists"
2nd China Doll. Food is amazing and interesting plus Woolloomooloo wharf is a great spot.
Third rec fir chinadoll. $65  set menu is something I would kill for.
"It's been a few years since I tried to get in to Kitchen by Mike, bookings were a long way in advance. I hope it's better now. Same for Firedoor"
The best sourdough in sydney as well! Carrot ravioli is a must try as well.
Not sure when OP is visiting but Automata will be closing at the end of the year

"Ester was horrid when I went a few months ago. The quality has absolutely plummeted in the last few years. 1 star, do not recommend"
Totally agree with everything you’ve said!
Did queen chow recently. Great food and price.
"Went to chophouse last week , agree it was excellent steak house."
I like [Cafe Paci](https://pegfeeds.com/2021/03/03/cafe-paci-newtown-nsw-restaurant-review/)! I wrote a pretty glowing review
Whoever downvoted this is tasteless swine
Bistrot 916(and highly recommended!) is great but it’s not owned by them.
"Dear Saint Eloise is fantastic, absolutely stellar wine list."
Oh wow that’s a bummer. I really enjoyed the food when I was there few months ago.
It’s incredible. I haven’t stopped thinking about it and I don’t even like desserts.
"I disagree, my boss and I went on an impromptu Friday a couple of months ago and had an amazing dinner! Right in the price range (not that I know, I didn't pay 🤣) but every meal was delicious and the wine we had was outstanding as well."
