Galaxy S20 Exynos. Couldn't even last a 8h work day without charging.
For me the Nexus 5x. Boot loop issues that LG and Google did not fix or offer any support. Just one random night my phone crashed and became a paper weight. It scared me right into Apple’s arms and I haven’t switched since.
"S20 exynos. I wasn’t really into looking at specs back then so I bought it thinking it should be good but obviously I was massively mistaken. That thing was an overheating piece of shit with terrible battery from day one. It was sent in for repair numerous times and nothing ever changed. 

That was the last time I’ll ever buy a Samsung phone and pretty much any product from them because they’ve all been terrible."
My first android - the sony Xperia S. looked great but very awkward to use. After that no regrets since I always do thorough research before buying and don’t buy anything at launch
"LG Optimus V. My first smartphone. It was something like $80 in 2012, had a 3.2"" plastic screen, and came with Froyo which I flashed to Gingerbread. Battery life was about half a day if I didn't use it often, and the compass frequently got confused and sent me the wrong way with Google Maps. I only had it for about 8 months before getting the Nexus 4."
Some Windows POS.
"iphone se2

TERRIBLE battery life.

best phone, xiaomi redmi note 5"
"HTC Thunderbolt. It was Verizon's first 4g LTE phone but it's battery couldn't really handle it. Like 8 hours with minimal use and well under half of that if you were using data. The thing was just painful to use without an outlet nearby.

Beyond that, the phone just had average performance, was chonky, and the UX was kind of janky from what I recall."
"BlackBerry Storm. Finicky touchscreen, slow, limited apps, no wifi capability. I swapped it for an iPhone 4 which was a huge leap forward."
Pixel 6xl
"LG G3, slowwww, laggy and would cook eggs all day long"
"Lg G4. The touchscreen never worked right.
I've been a nexus/pixel user since the G4 issues and I've never stopped using Google phones"
IPhone 6.
Anything that isn’t a flagship
"Motorola Photon on Sprint, that thing was a hot piece of garbage. Nice screen and design, constant random reboots and freezing up. I couldn't get a day where it didnt reboot or crash on me. Battery drain was a major issue too. 

The LG G2 is one of my top 10 favorites. Really fun phone."
Samsung flip 2 didn't last a year
The worst smartphone I owned was the BlackBerry Storm 9530. Fave? HTC One (M8).
"HTC touch pro (sprint edition) it wasn’t just bad it was stupidly bad. The battery lasted 2 and a half hours. It died so fast one day coming home from work I had to stop and buy a car charger. It would get so hot charging it would burn me. I went through 3 all had the same issue. I was very disappointed. I wanted that phone, but the performance was buggy slow. By far the worst phone I owned. Even though I only owned it for 3 months."
Samsung Galaxy Y Young.
"Note 20 Ultra Exynos. Overheated and lagged like hell, was always hot to the touch and just like every other Exynos phone I've owned the battery was trash. "
LG Optimus Extend 2 but it was 2015-2016 and I was 10-11 years old. The phone has 4gb of STORAGE and i could only have like 3-4 apps on the device before it ran out of storage. So if I wanted a new app had to delete one. And the screen was 480p. I did love it as a kid tho besides the annoying storage.
"I was so happy with my LG G2, my first Android after years using a Samsung Omnia W (Windows Phone 7). Broke the screen of my first one in an accident and brought another one because it was dirty cheap for a flagship device. Eventually moved to an Asus Zenfone 3, a midranget with 3gb of RAM and 32gb of storage, which compensated for the terrible screen. Unfortunately after one year the camera started having focus issues.Good times when brands tried to carve their space in the smartphone world."
I've had Great luck with Motorola over the last 10-12 yrs but I just get the $300 Moto G Power or similar models from before. I get 3 solid yrs out of that. Nuff said
"Honestly, I've been pretty lucky with smartphones.

This ZTE Feature Phone I had though was terrible. All I needed it to do was be used for calls, and after like 3 months my phone turned into a garbled mess on the other end.

I'm still rocking a Pixel 4a that had one of the battery problems. Google offered financial compensation, but the battery performance is still pretty shitty. Despite that, it's still a pretty good phone, I just have to keep it charged more often."
"The Storm 2 was actually a good phone. BlackBerry fixed the stupid design mistake that killed the QWERTY on the OG model. But by then, the DROID was released and it was game over.

The HTC ONE (M8) was a great looking phone. HTC just gave up like LG did.

I also owned the DROID, DROID 3 DROID 4."
"My first Pixel was the great 2XL. Last one was 6 Pro.

I'm a writer for Phone Arena...16 years. I'm working on a story about wanting to switch back to Pixel from iPhone. Probably will have it up later tonight."
I kind of a love-hate relationship with the  pixel 4 in many ways it was a really good phone but the battery life was horrible and I don't mean just like in the normal horrible way it was atrocious.
"Appreciate it. I never did get my Pixel story in. Couple of late stories took precedence…iOS 26 Beta 3 was released, and Trump’s beautiful bill gave the FCC its auction privileges back. I will aim for tomorrow.

I’m thinking of switching back to Pixel 10 Pro XL.

Anytime you want to talk phones, I’m here!"

"Some people might think I'm crazy, but the worst phone I ever owned was an iPhone 15 Pro Max. Not only would it overheat like crazy sometimes, but the battery life was awful, and it would drop calls all the time. I constantly had bugs as well, like apps crashing randomly, big lag spikes, and the keyboard would act stupid. It was a sign for me to switch back to Android 😂 I wanted to try a niche phone, so I got a RedMagic 10 Pro. I absolutely love this phone. Yes, I know it's a gaming phone, but it's been a fantastic daily driver for me."
"Probably my Nokia Lumia 930. A fucking WINDOWS phone. Only a few things ran on it and since I got it used from a relative, the battery was already down to okay and went to bad after the close to 3 years I've had it for. [Musical.ly](http://Musical.ly) (yes, I still remember that) would've cost while it was free on android or apple. My Huawei P10 Lite I had next was pretty great, I only replaced it after like 4.5 years due to a cracked screen and the battery barely lasting a day due to being on like 68%. My Galaxy A52s has honestly been perfect. Good screen (though too dim in direct sunlight when watching a dark scene in movies or series), good battery life, good battery longevity (still over 85% after three and a half years). I got an S23 FE Exynos from the company I started working for last year. I have mixed opinions on it. For once, it's really snappy with a decently bright screen but it's got quite sharp edges and the bezels are thicker than those of my A52s. It also uses a TON of power. I'm talking spikes of up to 14W. It does play Fortnite though, my A52s struggles heavily with it. Battery life is meh thanks to the Exynos and its massive power draw. It also only lasts 2 min once it reaches 5% and gets really, really laggy."
HTC desire HD that battery was horrendous but I love their weather animations and sense UI and still miss it so nostalgic when I watch videos. HTC one M8 was the most satisfying phone along with iPhone 4s white and galaxy S3. Those days were so joyful as we were exploring new techs in phones. The most boring phone today for me is iPhone 16 pro max and best value phone is Poco f7.
"Samsung Galaxy Spica - first foray into Android. Was barely more than a limited tech demo, the whole OS (1.6 and 2.2) was disappointing, the hardware was underspecced and it still ate the battery super fast. Sold it quickly and went back to Symbian Nokias (E72) until the bitter end."
"Ah man. I loved my LG G2... until I didn't. 
My worst smartphone was also my first one. It was a Samsung Galaxy Exhibit, and was one of those free phones T-Mobile offered if you joined their service lol."
"The Xperia Z5 Compact.

It came with less RAM than the standard version, which meant it was slow and suffered from crashes despite having a powerful processor.

On the other hand, despite having a top-notch camera sensor, the software was terrible and didn't get the most out of it.

It overheated a lot, and the battery quickly degraded.
The back was made of glass, and despite having a case, it shattered into pieces and ended up falling apart.
The touch sensor was on the side and didn't work properly.

This was a shame, because the phone was beautiful and its compact size was very comfortable to use and carry."
Anything Samsung
"Everything from Samsung was rather bad. 
I had the XCover, in various issues like XCover 3 and so on. 
At the time Samsung was the only supplier for ""affordable"" tough phones. 
They were all weak in CPU and RAM. Thankfully some had expendable storage. 
The first was the only tough one. Nearly indestructible. 
The third broke from a drop of less than knee height. That's when I left. 
Also Samsung gives you Samsung apps for ""every"" Google app there is. 
That's double the bloatware. 
Annoying and useless. I don't need two apps for notes, or files, or pictures thank you. 
I feel Samsung is generally bad. Sure big, but bad. 
I used some Chinese models (doogee, and something else) they all failed within 2 years, which is too annoying for me.
I changed to Google, because I don't really need a tough phone anymore. A good case and a waterproof phone are enough now. And using a Google android means there is only one grabby kraken collecting my data."
"iPhone 3G...
iPhones are much better than they were. Back then, I was coming from, if I remember correctly, a Windows Mobile device. The iPhone was more stable, but the stupid thing couldn't actually DO anything, which was why it was so stable. 😂

I only used it for a few months before switching to Android.

I've had some stinker Android devices, too... Back when they'd put 4 g of SLOW RAM and a turd for a processor in them and call it a day."
"Sony Ericsson Xperia X10 Mini Pro, 2010-2012

I honestly didn't know what I'm getting into. But finding out that my phone runs Android and is updatable, got me intrigued and excited at first. But it left me disappointed when I read that the manufacturer won't update to the Android version that supports App2SD. It prevented me from using otherwise compatible apps that took more storage than what was available in the device itself. Android seemed like a somewhat standardized operating system, but - unlike what I experienced on PCs - needed heavy customization by the manufacturer to run at all on the device. This realization dragged me to Custom ROMs, which was exciting for some time, until the always broken home-made ROMs by some randoes (no offense, thanks for the effort) made me tired of the whole thing.

Some apps like VLC Player or a Nintendo 64 emulator were announced months if not years before release and ended up not being compatible with the ARMv6 SoC in the device. Huge disappointment.

I was so pissed that from 2012 up until 2018 I switched to Windows Phone and only returned upon Microsoft's announcement that the platform will be discontinued. I'm back to Android, because I stubbornly refuse to get an iPhone, but I don't hate Android as much as back then, although I'd prefer not to use Android and have a third option."
Does the htc dash count? Cause that.
I loved my Droid Bionic!  My worst=Umidigi Power 1 lol
"2023 
Xiaomi 12

What a piece of crap.

Calls didnt ring
System constantly crashing and rebooting 
Lag

But well... 140$, couldnt expect that much"
Samsung Google Nexus... The battery life was atrocious 😵‍💫
"14pro max.
 It just turns out i was unlucky with the phone , used it for a month and it got to bootloop 2 times while also dropping from 98 to 89 in around a month.
The phone would lag scrolling twitter and always run extremely hot.
The rear camera especially didn't feel as good as the oneplus 12 i had before particularly the telephoto.  But yeah i was just unlucky with the phone"
"Motorola G. I think that was the name. It was their first waterproof one. Awful 720p display. Slow. Plain UI 

It put me off Motorola for life"
Galaxy s2. Sudden death.
"Blackberry Curve when Telus did not yet have iPhones.  It promised internet access but really that was just an hourglass animation app.  I still have no idea how to get music onto it.  Felt cheap, very creaky plastic. "
"Samsung galaxy note 7, the thing fking exploded.

Too scared to own any Samsung products anymore (even if its now close to imposible to happen again)"
Mine was the Nextbit Robin or the Moto E4
Galaxy S10. It’s a bloated single handed nightmare
iphone SE gen 1
Myb weir or as americans say you know sh*t but in my family there were only 2 iphones. 13 and 16. Battery is shit so anyone saying it can last day or two stop laying. They would heat up from watching tt on mobile data and just surfing with it. Moved to samsung and had no problems at all. Iphone are smoth but that all they are just phone you can have 2 options no customization no nothing. I need phone that I can change everything not just color of my apps.
"iPhone 13, my current phone and the only iPhone I’ve ever used. Moving back to Android after retiring this."
"LG G4 and iPhone 12 Pro Max.....  The lg had a horrible battery and cell reception,  the iPhone 12 Pro Max had cell connectivity issues"
"Poco , OS was a joke , it was like using a developer build. Don’t know how people like that junk."
"For me maybe the Asus Zenfone 2. I don't call it the worst totally since I've been using it for past 3 years until I replaced it with Galaxy s8+. My only issue with that is the x86 architecture it has because of intel processor on it and intel dropping support for it so it hurts some app compatibilities. Even though it is 64-bit capable, it is limited to run on 32-bit because of x86 architecture. Poor battery life also because of excessive heating sometimes. Overall, I enjoyed using it because its the 1st smartphone that has 4gb of ram where other manufacturers still stucked to 2-3gb and 64gb storage that time was massive at affordable price where that time this storage is only limited to flagships."
12 pro max. Legitimately have no idea how people like iOS. Was a terrible experience.
"Redmi note 12 pro 4g. 
Even my old phone Redmi Note 6 Pro works smoother"
"Xiaomi Mi 10 Lite

Had great experience with Xiaomi before (and after) having this, but it sucked. 
Battery got bad really fast, fingerprint sensor started malfunctioning and just ""disappeared"" from settings, power on/off button stopped working soon after that so I had to use workarounds to turn the phone on or off.

So yeah, it sucked.

Also an expensive slider phone from Samsung (I don't remember the type) that kept malfunctioning straight out of the box. After multiple ""reparations"" I just gave up on the brand for a long time."
Samsung Galaxy Nexus. Terrible storage
"Always the cheap ones. I had a motorola moto... G7? I dont remember exactly. Maybe g6? It was around 2017. Camera? Not great but I didn't care. Big screen, nice looking and had that ""turbo charging"". The issue with it was eventually the charger wouldnt seat correctly and I couldnt for the life of me find ANYTHING stuck in the port. Eventually it refused to turbo charge, and after that It would only charge if I turned the phone on in some developer mode to bypass whatever the heck was preventing it in the OS. Im not necessarily faulting motorola as it could have been carelessness on my end but it wasn't enjoyable in the end.

 Another bad one was my samsung galaxy J7 Sky pro. It too had bad cameras but a weird glitch. No matter how many youtube updates I got, youtube never worked right. It would *constantly* just have a black screen where the video should be playing but continue to play the audio. No fixes ever worked for me. Eventually I gave it to my dad and he used it up until last year (to rub salt in the wound, youtube NEVER gave him any issues...) anything past that would be me bashing 40 dollar mid 2010 androids and that... That just wouldnt be fair"
Some cheapo Samsung years ago I bought for like $50 after my last phone died a bad death. Just to hold me over until I could save for something a little better. I do t even know the name .
"iPhone 3GS

It was my first smartphone and my first Apple product. Yes, it was quite innovative with a nice looking UI, but omg it was so unstable.

Safari was crashing as soon as you had too many tabs opened.

After that bitter experience, I switched to a Samsung Galaxy S III and never came back to Apple.

Fun fact, the S3 was the phone I kept the longest... 6 years before a final brutal drop that killed it.

I still enjoy the Galaxy S line nowadays and was never disappointed."
Pretty much loved all Samsungs S1 through the S10 series minus the s5 model :)
"Asus Zenfone Live.

Died on me in less than a year. Bad camera, bad charging port and scratch-sensitive that it looks so worn out in just a few years."
"Alcatel , 60hz , slö Charger 2.5 hours and 4000mah and bad batteri bad processor , everything bad only THE Price was 400zlotych which is really cheap but should have researched more detailed the phone market to buy better smth"
"Pixel 7. 

Google has destroyed the phones I once loved."
"LG V20 - LG tried to gaslight the store and myself that ""AMOLED screens are allowed to have burn-in"". It was an LCD screen, store refunded me the difference and emptied it's stock of LG phones because of all the trouble.

It would have been a great phone with better software and hardware support, but that's why LG are no longer in the picture. 🤷🏻‍♂️"
"LG G3 is the worst phone I’ve had. It was laggy especially when it was running Android Lolipop, plus the phone overheated all the time and the battery barely made past a high school day. (4 pm) I’ve never bought another LG after that. "
Oneplus 8 - worst camera. Yellow grainy picture machine.
"Motorola Defy Mini (2012 to 2014)

Followed by one of the infamous Windows phones, Nokia 635. It's a shame because the OS was pretty much flawless, but the App Store ? Pretty much like Huawei now, you had to do without Google apps, instead you relied on sketchy copies. And no Clash of Clans while everyone in high school was playing it, dammit !

Then I got a Huawei P9 and it was like Renaissance after the Dark Ages"
"Qualcomm QCP-2700 from Sprint early 2000’s, talk about a brick of a phone!"
The worst phone was the pixel 6 and in second place the pixel 8.
"HTC Desire 816G. I've never sold any of my phones for malperformance except for this one. Bought it as a secondary phone for light usage with not-very-high expectations, yet it managed to perform even way worse than I expected. Sold it four months later for a 60% loss."
"what were your best phones, I’m gonna make a wild guess and say it’s the Google Pixel op"
Samsung Moment. What a laggy horrible phone
"There was a OnePlus a few years ago I had to get rid of in less than a week because of the curved edge tech. It was annoying and unnecessary. I had gotten it because it was one of the few with higher refresh rate at the time. 

Then also there was an LG that I can't remember the model of that had a 'leather' back that would just turn off and restart randomly even midcall that put me off LG phones for life."
"LG Stylo 6, the first one i got worked perfectly fine for me... until it got water damage and I had to get a replacement. The 2nd one was hell. Idk wtf they did to it, but it always froze, or force shut down apps. Got super annoying pretty fast so I got a replacement

The next would me the Motorola G Power... that one was pretty laggy honestly, got annoying quickly. Also force shut down apps"
The cheap-ass AT&T Calypso I was given when they shut down 3G.
Nexus 5 X or the LG Optimus G pro.
"Samsung s22. The exynos chip in it was inefficient, the phone was constantly overheating and stuttering. Battery held for half to 3/4 of a day maximum. Finally one month after end of warranty, after (official) update, the phone overheated affecting the motherboard and the phone is stuck in a booting loop and unusable. Of course Samsung denied any responsibility. Never buying a Samsung again."
"Motorola A1000. Chunky, heavy, lacked everything, and had the least responsive touch screen I have ever experienced."
"Always been a huge sony fan. They made 1 bad model though. The xperia z3+. The phone was based of a regular z3, but made thinner. This of course resulted in really poor cooling. So whenever I tried to take photos in summer, the phone would instantly close the camera dude to overheating, making the camara rather useless."
"Xiaomi Mi 11 followed by Samsung galaxy s22 ultra (Exynos).
Both got hot and battery was unreliable. Xiaomi developed a faulty battery that got replaced, weeks later the phone died. They replaced it with a brand new Xiaomi 12 and I sold that one asap."
Lg G  Flex 2
"ZenFone Go 2015

And a Nubia Z60 Ultra LV"
"Xperia Z3+ The phone got hot like a iron box 
LG flex2... Was an awesome phone until bootloop"
"Blackview A7. Multitouch was Limited to two points. 


It was impossible to turn off the boot sound, and at the same time long pressing the power button would reboot. So you'd hear the boot sound regularly. "
Samsung i5700 spica. It was half baked product. Other one o think is HTC Desire HD. This phone was getting hoot
"Xiaomi Redmi 9A

Its my work phone... God, what a laggy, unresponsive low quality piece of trash"
"Umidigi Bison.

I bought it because I needed a rugged phone to take camping, to music festivals, canoeing etc. It also has really good specs for a rugged phone, which I wanted as I want to be able to use it for everything I use my normal phone for.

The downside: I had no idea it was possible to implement stock Android this wrong. It's incredibly buggy, crashes in weird ways, can't even make phone calls properly at times (it doesn't have sound until I turn the loudspeaker mode on and off again), etc. The GPS they claimed is super accurate because they also use Galileo and glonas is probably the least accurate of all devices I owned.

For the entire three years I had this phone, it received one single update just called ""some Bugfixes"". It did actually fix a bug where it would randomly restart several times a day so that's good I guess?

It's such a shame because except for that it's actually good. The battery life is great and when it's not bugging out, it can do everything I need."
Samsung Galaxy Note 8 (Exynos Version). The phone was very fragile and I got the back nicked within a month despite having a case and the battery life always was bad.
Sony Xperia XZ3
Galaxy S22 Exynos. Atrocious battery life. Almost unusable.
I had a droid RAZR and it was alright  I had lg viewty and the screen was annoying since it was  resistive but this was in like 2007 lol
Galaxy J3 2017. So bad.
"Worst iPhone I’ve used was the 8 plus only because of how underwhelming it was. It’s criminal how that fruit company can get away with that. Immediately made to the jump back to android and got an S8+ .
Worst android was probably my htc evo- got it at a time that my carrier didn’t support the device so I had to use a custom rom and that shit was sooo buggy."
"iPhone 12. Terrible battery & seemed very flimsy.

Worst iPhone I ever used. Changed to android/Google Pixel. Best thing I ever did."
Samsung s3
"My current phone, a Galaxy S25. As a device it’s fine, but its camera is severely disappointing, since Samsung has been using the same small camera sensor for 4 years now. The S25 in particular is actually worse than its predecessor in how it handles post processing for photos. 

Other than that, nothing is improved on it from the 24. Battery life struggles, software is janky and attempting to copy Apple at every turn. If I wanted to use iOS I’d kept my iPhone"
"iPhone Xs as a replacement while my S23U was in the mail. 

I hated the modern ios, didin't trust the facial recognition system  and the battery life was appaling even despite the thing having nearly new battery. My last experiences with ios were with the last good iphone, the 6s paired with ios 9. The navigation system was weird to use and took a long time to get used to. It wasn't fun using it at all. 

As a smartphone it wasn't the worst one by any means, that would go to the budget Galaxy i had years ago. But by far the worst user experience out of any phone i've owned."
Blackberry z30
"O2 XDA II mini.
It came with several dead pixels and I couldn't exchange for a new one."
"The Galaxy Note 8 was the biggest disappointment. It just never grew on me (big fan of the Note series otherwise), and then it died with a faulty motherboard."
"Worst flagship: LG G5

Worst overall? 

Easily Samsung Wave 3 with their crappy Bada OS"

"Xiaomi mi a2 - got it after I broke my iphone 7 and realized I need a decent soc or I'd go insane lol


For reference I have a pixel 7a now and I think it's fast enough"
"iPhone 16pro. Coming from an iPhone 5s and an iPhone 8 which i considered already way too big, I just absolutely hate the size of those monstrous modern phones. Fuck that bricks, give me back the iPhone 5s form factor with modern technology"
Xperia 5
"All mine would've been solid for the time since I spend a lot of time comparing before buying. But if I had to choose one, it would be Sony Xperia Z1C. It was the only one that died on me for no particular reason (like drops, spills, etc.). Also its gallery management is horrible, mixing in tons of thumbnails with actual images.  This wasn't a problem with their subsequent models."
"Galaxy A9 2018. Thought it was gonna be a banger midrange phone. One of the earliest to adapt the triple camera setup. Turns out it isn't even that great. But it's still alive though, I use it as my backup."
"Motorola Droid, my grandma got me it and put me on her plan when I was 10."
"Redmi Note 9 - wasn't terrible overall but had constant ads imposed as system notifications. Some system links led to Chinese pages. At one point it just turned off repeatedly. It was also slow compared to contemporary phones (granted, it was also a lot cheaper). 

Huawei P10 or P20, can't remember - I liked it but the battery swelled shortly after one year.

I know that Chinese smartphones have come a long way, especially if you pay midrange or flagship prices. But I have no plans to return to them."
Apple iPhone 11
"The Droid Razer had the best ergonomics for me. The camera bar in the back was perfect for holding the phone. We had two, my wife and I, and we had them for several years with no issues. I also liked the slim profile and carbon fiber back. Yes, battery life was not great and the display was just ok, good for the time I suppose, but we did not have performance issues.

The worst reliability was the Pixel 3XL. That phone always ran hot. The WiFi chip unsoldered itself while navigating during a hot day in Florida. The phone rebooted for overheating and never had wifi again.

The best was the Pixel 2 XL. I still have two that I use for testing and app development. Still works great, with a good battery and still good display and performance in 2025. Remarkable."
"Oneplus 7 pro 5G.
I came from a Nexus 6P and thought the camera was subpar. Didn’t look particularly good. Barely had any updates from OnePlus. Good performance though.. but the lack of updates pushed me from any OnePlus devices since"
Iphone 4
Samsung S85000 Wave. It was on the cusp of the switch to smartphones and it was Samsung's attempt to make their own OS. Ended up never downloading any apps and did everything through the browser.
"Pixel 6 Pro.

Using it as GPS during a hot sunny day? Forget about it, it will overheat and turn off in 30 minutes.

Never had this problem with any other phone."
"Iphone 12 pro and 15pro. For what you pay for, these things are pure shit......"
s22 ultra exynos
 Asus with the Intel Atom processor
"The worst phone I ever owned was the Razer Phone 1337, which I imported from the USA. It worked fine for about a week, but then the fingerprint sensor on the side stopped working. I complained, and they took the phone back and sent me a replacement, which took two weeks. Unfortunately, after about two weeks with the new device, the earpiece stopped working. I returned that device as well and finally got a full refund."
"Windows phone 7. I bought into the whole ""windows system will be the next IPhone killer"" mentality. My friend had an android phone and we were comparing my Utorrent app which I used to monitor my downloads from my computer on my windows phone, and his phone literally just had Utorrent. I was surprised that the app could be on a phone at that time. 
But what really shattered my delusions on this phone was when I was reading the description of the upcoming update on my phone to brag to him and came across the ability to ""copy and paste"". He laughed his ass off. I hadn't realized that for the few months that I'd had the phone there was never an option to copy or paste anything. They had a really cool 3d puzzle game to show off how powerful this phone was but no damn copy/paste. I was done at that point and I bought my first Samsung Galaxy."
"Probably the Galaxy S20 FE 5G. It was laggy, overheated and barely lasted half a day. Galaxy S22 Ultra might be the second one."
"Pixel 7 Pro. That thing could not hold a phone call. Mobile reception was terrible, WiFi calling didn’t work, all in places where previous phones were fine. The 6 prior to that and the Pixel 8 Pro weren’t much better. Totally put me off trying another one since."
"LG G5 .The battery life was hideous, I would have to charge multiple times because the battery drains like hell."
Redmi Note 8
Google Pixel 7 and 8.(First gen Sensor chip) Great camera shite software for the things you need a phone for. Buggy and unreliable.
"Any phone that had reddit hype around them like early iPhones (same reasons why the main developer that made jailbreaking possible moved to the Fold), and half of the Google phones (from dev phone to Pixels, though Nexuses were great). The phones with most complaints were the best, like the Galaxy.

Though I also like few phones besides Galaxy, those brands were far more inconsistent for me to like them. Combining my experience with the Nexus phones and the Galaxy phones, I realised that Samsung is most consistently great, and prioritised what I prioritised.

I don't think it was the best or the worst, but I also loved the G2. Fortunately, it worked fine for me for a long time though."
Motorola Razr+ 2023; the battery sucks.
"Xiaomi 14T Pro. And I imagine every other Xiaomi is more or less the same.

Notifications and Control Panel are separated, in an Apple style, and you can't change it. It is cluttered and annoying to use. ""System Optimization"" is ass, not in the way that it does nothing, but that it does too much, in every wrong way. It locks some games to 60, 144hz screen sees 120 fps 3 times a day, battery charges fast but discharges too fast (0-100 in 40 mins, 100-0 in a day and a half with mild usage, 5-6h of videos and 4h of gaming), heats up fast and a lot (hits 50°C really easily). I bought it to record in 60 fps, 1080p while also playing at 120 fps without worrying about overheating or frame drops, and it should easily do that, with a MediaTek 9300+ (marginally better than a SnapDragon 8 Gen 3, found on the S24 Ultra for example). The cameras are nice, but the software downright suuuuuckkssss. I've used a Huawei P Smart and, while slower, I liked the UI a lot more."
Tecno camon 20 pro 4g i just want a 2nd phone for socmed but it sucks its lagging when i open 3 to 4 apps
"I'll properly upgrade next year or the year after, if it lasts that long / it doesn't get worse battery wise. 
I'll get something ""old"" though, like the 9 or 10 (if there is any ... These days you never know about the numbers). 
That's because I'll pay once and be done with it - and don't want to pay more than 10% of what I make a month. It's just not worth more in my opinion."
iPhone 5 was dead by the time I got to work & I had to charge it all day just to use it. There was a class action lawsuit because they were found guilty of deliberately releasing software to slow down the older phones to encourage new purchases but of course my serial number didn’t qualify.
Kyorcra Duraforce I believe it was called. It had one of those off year snapdragon processors that overheated doing basic tasks. I thought it was a Japanese phone and being water resistant would be cool. Boy was I wrong thinking that. I only used it for a day and I think either returned it or flipped it.
"One Plus 7 the bastard started getting switch off dozens of times everyday even in the middle of a call. This started happening post Android version update. 


When I checked online even on their website forum there were so many people facing the same issue and company couldn't fix it. Such an expensive phone worst experience I had. I had to throw it away eventually.


I'm surprised it still a sought after brand. After that experience I'll never take oneplus even if given for free."
"Galaxy S8 Plus Exynos, trash cameras, constant app crashes and bugs. Haven’t bought a Samsung ever since."
"Galaxy s7s (plural) 

Trash phones, trash batteries, trash antennas. Just fucking trash. Samsung makes stinker ass phones."
"Samsung M14.. my current 2nd//bkackup phone.

Its laggy. The camera is for slow leisure photography.. the shutter response is that slow. 

I started with a Sony Ericsson Xperia Live with walkman.. and a Moto G 1st gen, Nokia Lumia etc.. even with their low specs they were better performers for their time than the M14 is for 2025. Its an entry level phone.. but any motorola in the same price range can outperform it in speed anytime."
Samsung A05 64gb ... creeps me out daily 😢
HTC desire c. Pretty and all but the battery lasted only an hour or two. Free phone the provider gave me. First smartphone I owned. It just wasn't really functional in a meaningful way. I ended up not being accessable and my family called the cops to find me lol
"Mine also lg, it's been robbed by me...f**k"
Honestly pixel 6a. I really like the phone everything about it. But battery life is not good and everywhere i see after 400 charge cycles it will be horrendous and i am at 300. I bought it with a mind of using it for 2 yrs. Actually it is a really good phone hut i just am so fixated on a good battery and the seller said the battery is perfect which isn't. And it heats up
"HTC 10, was meh from day one and completely decayed after a year or two. Made a mistake buying it instead of Galaxy S7 or Mi6 in 2017.

Or if I count anything I used short-term too - Xperia 5-2. It was so awful that I sold it after three days."
"My iPhone 7, but not when it was my main phone, when it was a side device on iOS 15. Slow as hell, got hotter than a stove burner, and had terrible battery life."
Hands down the HTC Legend from around 2010. It overheated while using it to the point of being unusable. I wanted to love this phone so bad and this probably added to the bad taste it left in my mouth.
Oneplus 9 wanna know why? read [https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/1lt6j7e/my\_oneplus\_9\_just\_died\_completely\_is\_there/](https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/1lt6j7e/my_oneplus_9_just_died_completely_is_there/)
"For my family it's the iPhone 16 PM, my mom got one, considering the price of the phone it's absolutely terrible. Always freezes, part of the screen around the action button has problems and stops working sometimes, it's always crashing, the camera is awful and processing makes it look like AI slop, and IOS feels worse than ever. Considering it was several hundred dollars more than the price of my 1VI it's horrendous, Apple of yesteryear is dead."
REVVL 7 😂
"IPhone SE.

Got it as a company phone, first phone in apple universe. Wanted to throw it at the wall every day. Might have not been the phones fault, but iOS unusability in general"
"I have a work iPhone 14 that is a total abomination, bluetooth disconnects, battery drain 5-10% a day .. And it's stock it's a work phone so it has outlook and that's it.. "
"J3 Prime, absolutely do not miss that phone."
"Nexus 6.
The camera was lagging like crazy when the battery was low."
"For me, The Nokia N95. It dropped calls, I missed important calls and, at the time, my eldest has just been born prematurely and my wife ended up so frustrated with them, we binned them"
"Samsung Galaxy S3 back in 2012. Was too average for a flagship phone back in the day, didn't even last 2 years for me."
"Galaxy s8 + the sound when taking a phone call was terrible, always had to ask people to repeat themselves. I had the same problem on replacement phone and ended up taking it back and demanding my money back. That was another battle as well. .!!!"
Galaxy S22 Exynos. Damn that thing sucked. The S24 Exynos wasn't much better tho.
"I had one of the early razers around 2006ish.

It was not my first phone. It was a BIG downgrade from my indestructible Nokia.

Dirt immediately got first in the flip mechanism and started getting crunchy when I opened it which pissed me off.

I was pissed that I had to use two hands for opening it. It was a full extra step, my Nokia had the keys on the front. I could take it out of my pocket and use it while riding my bike with the other hand. Couldn't do that with the razer.

Also, there was a camera and website access the Nokia didn't have. This sounds like a huge upgrade, but they were unusable. The web browser hardly worked at all, and the camera cover got scratched very easily and was so blurry. It also didn't have the Nextel walkie talkie feature that was cool at the time. 

Close second was my iPhone 14ish pro. Tried switching from my Pixel to iPhone. I couldn't do it. I stuck it out for 29 days, and on the last day of the return window I sent it back."
Pixel 5a 5g. went dead in exactly 12 months after warranty expired.
"Sony Xperia L couldn't keep up to save its life. Constant crashing and restarting. Beautiful phone though. And I had the Motorola Droid Razr. Good phone, just lets down by a heavy ICS update and being one of the early LTE phones."
Asus Zenphone Selfie. why did I even buy it.
S20.  Died after an update (black screen) and they wouldn't cover it.
sony xperia xa1. shittiest build quality ever.
"Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max, definitely."
"I had a sprint HTC phone many years ago, shitty service and phone. Ever since I've had  Samsungs and they last a long time. My current Samsung I've had since 2019"
"Pixel 7 Pro. Biggest piece of junk ever. It overheated constantly, the camera sucked and couldn’t focus worth crap, and I dropped it one time, on its corner, WITH A CASE from about 4 feet up and it died. Barely made it 8 months, so glad I could go back to iPhone at that point."
"Moto Play something 2016ish, phone itself was fine, little bit of start up Bloatware ,had cool features shake and the light turns on, but got a blue inky screen of death in a couple months."
"LG Aristo (first one, IIRC). The display was dim, lackluster, and not very sharp. Build quality was cheap and toy-like. Sound quality sucked ass, too (speaker was on the back cover)."
One plus nord 2
Samsung galaxy A04s
Samsung Galaxy S8 - I looked at it and the glass broke.
"Samsung S23 Ultra, its just batty. The auto correct seem broken and the screen goes weird. I've only had it for 18 months. Don't think I'll ever get a S series of Samsung phones again.

Oh sometimes it doesnt charge correctly or even hold kts charge too."
s7 edge easily as the edge display was absolute ass and prone to accidentally activating the edge display. Was bitter after having to give up my note 7.
"Redmi note 12 4g 4gb ram
Very laggy,no notification pop-ups, overheating problem"
"Galaxy s7 edge. Loved the look and innovation of a curved edge screen, sounded and looked cool on paper and in videos/pictures. But in practice I would accidentally touch or do a gesture due to the edges. Also, constantly had issues where the phone would be sitting in my pocket, not in use, would leave the house with 100% battery and it would randomly get extremely hot and drain battery to like 40%. Towards the end of my first year with my phone I had to put the phone in power saving mode to last the day, I had cleared the cache and Uninstalled some apps that just drained battery in the background to resolve the issue. I wasn't familiar with android phones so learning to manage it was a little extra leg work, and even then I'd still randomly have moments where the phone would heat up and would require a reboot. After the first year, my phone had trouble lasting an entire day on 1 charge. Then, if overheating wasn't happening, my phone would have random moments of being extremely slow. Apps weren't well optimized for the galaxy phones yet, but this experience was enough to get me to switch and stay with apple for the next 10 ish years. Now I'm back with the s25 ultra, and it's been a better experience thus far."
Pixel 2
"Google pixel , ,( the only true reason to use one , is spam filter that is bonkers , near perfect as it gets , hold for me , and call screening , besides that better not have one ,  their quality control is subpar and their specs should never be allowed to be called a flagship"
"Samsung Galaxy Ace 1. This was a hand me down from my mother's phone plan renewal. I know it's a low-end device at the time, but it made me switch back to a Nokia E63 which is also from my mother's phone plan.

The Samsung was not only laggy, but only lasted about an hour or 2 of continuous usage. The standby time was also less than 2 days despite a new battery. It had a Google Playstore, but it couldn't run most apps without stuttering."
Samsung galaxy a10e finally got a new phone good riddance
"Sony Xperia Z

It was a ""gimmick"" phone, one of the first waterproof phones, i dont remember if it was actually the first one. As an avid swimmer, i was sold instantly.

It had all these flaps that would close off all the holes on the phone, like charging port, SD card, headphone jack etc.

Phone literally fell apart in my hand, all the flaps broke off by regular use, lockscreen button broke off, plastic started peeling off. Literally just regular, daily use, didnt last 6 months."
Samsung galaxy 3 I believe I had this as my first proper phone and it always had an issue but I loved the cool things you can add like cases were fun back then etc
Motorola edge 40 neo
"used to own cheap Lenovo phones, it broke every year

after own 3 times, i couldn't stand it anymore and bought Huawei Nova instead"
Lumia 930.
"Galaxy S22 Exynos. I love the design and Samsung in general, but the battery and slowness of that phone... When you take 3 photos, the phone becomes slow as my grandfather's computer (trust me, it's very slow), and the battery just simply disappears."
Galaxy A series
"Probably the Motorola Droid Charge. It had some redeeming qualities, like being one of the first LTE phones on Verizon, and it had a large (for the time) super AMOLED screen. 

Beyond that, though, it was underpowered, had terrible battery life (ironic given the name), would overheat constantly, and had a lot of software bloat."
iPhone 16 sucks
"iPhone 15 plus.  Shock switching from Android.  Editing text an exercise in frustration, for example."
BlackBerry Storm 2. Very laggy and bad battery life.
"iPhone 15, I’m almost positive the people who rave about iPhones have never used a droid.   iPhones are so limited in what they can do and what I used to do with just 1 button push, on iPhone find myself having to push 3 buttons.   Also with a droid to do things everything is fairly obvious while iPhone you should probably read the instructions"
iPhone 15
"Xiaomi 12 with snapdragon 8 gen 1. Shitty batery life and overheating for no reason, just scrolling socials."
Samsung galaxy but it was years ago
"Nokia n96, absolutely terrible phone. After that LG G3, thing kept rebooting on it’s own."
My Sony Xperia z5 offer not much upgrade compared to my old Xperia z1 and the camera is so shit the comparable in price Samsung Galaxy S7 stomp em to the ground. Not to mention the battery died in just 2 years
Samsung galaxy A05s
"LG G6 

that 💩 throttle opening Whatsapp"
iPhone 6
"My current phone the OnePlus 12. I would rather have a AT&t Go phone from the 2000s. 

It overheats constantly drop cell network and Wi-Fi freezes up randomly resets lags out and so much more. 

It overheats against so hot that it cracked the back glass. It's in a military grade case and went through my windshield and was lodged when I had my accident and nothing was broken. 

Paid over $500 for it and it's an absolute piece of dumpster fire"
Iphone 7
"No, I had the 6 and loved it until the battery went to shit...(apple got sued for knowingly selling cheap and bootleg batteries.)"
ZTE by far..
"Samsung M31. Ultrawide was there but didn't work, phone couldn't do shit and display died in just over 1.5 yrs"
"Huawei p40 lite - was too late when i found out google was not supported on this phone (google apps, playstore)
Motorola edge 40 - worst camera and worst software support, many bugs, including mic issues from day one and it was never fixed"
My favorite by far is the edge S8
iPhoneYes
"Hot take, my galaxy S4 had the phone die at 49% and then i found it one day bloated screen and all"
Samsung Galaxy S2. 
BlackBerry Storm.  The touch screen was horrible.  Rims first attempt at touchscreen.
"HTC One V and Xiaomi Mi Max Prime. They were both GREAT phones, until suddenly they weren't. The One V got outdated almost within a year or two of it's release. Mi Max Prime's battery was amazing at first, then started draining quick after two years of use."
LG Prada.  It was cool and sleek but I didn't do much with it at the time
Samsung Mega 😂
[removed]
"Galaxy S3 with the loose battery and awful bloatware. 

Pixel 7 Pro. A heavy awkward phone that loved to leap out of my hands even with a case. And yeah the screen busted."
"Samsung Galaxy s7.
Not because it was a bad phone. Just because Samsung took years to release the 2 software updates you got back then."
Blackberry. Only used it for two weeks when I was between androids. How was even considered a smartphone?
"Honor magic 7 pro

It is currently the one I use, in reality it would be a 10/10, but the screen has a problem of excessive sensitivity, but I notice it is only software since it does not happen in the Google feat news or in Chrome.
For example, when you scroll down on Instagram and lift your finger, the screen ""sometimes"" continues to go down, just for a few millimeters. I tried a friend's s23 ultra, which in theory is the same technology, ltpo, 120 hz etc.
But nothing to see, it has improved a lot but they still haven't solved it, a lot of people also criticize the camera, but it seems to me to be a ""correct"" camera within the price."
"Google Pixel 7, hot garbage"
"One plus 13 was the worst device I owned, truly awful in every way"
"Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge (Exynos). By far. The thing would overheat all the time and was always slow AF. I did only get it for making my substratum themes for it, in the meantime I used a OnePlus 5 without issues. 
But it was a massive pain. 

I've had plenty of smartphones:
Samsung omnia HD (symbian), Samsung Galaxy S1, Galaxy Nexus, Nexus 5, OnePlus 5, Galaxy S6 Edge, iPhone 8 (during Apple developer Academy), Galaxy S9 (Exynos, not great either), OnePlus 7 Pro, iPhone 13 Pro, Galaxy S24 Ultra (Snapdragon, finally a good Samsung and the one I'm writing from)."
"I had a RAZR and thought it was so cool to be able to put mp3s on my phone...  Oh, I can't do that..  I need to download iTunes just to copy files...  Oh I need to convert every single mp3 in AAC..  

My phone finally died just before I was moving overseas so I got given an old iphone8.   I will never understand how they got so popular while being such a pain in the ass about everything to use

Edit, it was Rokr not razr"
HTC evo 3d had a common issue that rendered parts of the touch screen useless
"Oneplus 12r

Missed half the notifications, ALL apps were killled in the background no matter the setting"
Simple - iphone
"My worst phones-Samsung s21 and Google pixel 6 

My best phone-Samsung s23 pixel8 pixel9pro iphone13 pro max iPhone14 pro"
n97 maybe? it was a sluggish nightmare but I loved it anyway
Motorola Droid
Moto G2
"T-Mobile G2x by LG. That thing would overheat and lock up requiring me to pull the battery to restart it. I tried didn't custom ROMs to try and get it running better with minimal luck. I think there ended up being a class action for that phone.

Second worst was the Samsung Galaxy s21. It seemed like that one left half baked due to COVID-19. After 4-5 months of updates it finally started running smoothly. That's the phone that got me to switch to iPhones for the first time. 

Hopefully I'll be back to Android one day. I like Android over iOS, but really like how well the apple watch works vs the Galaxy watch I had been using."
"Galaxy A15. I daily drive this and this crap cannot multitask.
Playing Apple music in the background while I scroll through Reddit and am would just stop after few min. Even switching apps hangs and lags."
"LG G6. It had great features; ultra wide camera, fingerprint reader on the back, and it was 2 x 1 aspect ratio like a lot of modern Androids. 


It's also the only phone I have had hardware failures with. The fingerprint sensor stopped working unless you put the phone facedown and used your palm and body weight to press the back of the phone hard. 

Then it would work for a little while until the connection opened up again. 

The SIM tray would also jam and break off in the phone. It was enough of an issue you could buy SIM trays for it on Amazon. The phone store broke one, and later I broke another."
Samsung Note 3. I hated that phone so much.
iPhone 12 Pro (my current phone)
"Pixel , galaxy and iPhone are the worst 

It doesn't matter what model all suck big time 

Small battery , slow ass charging speed , old and or mediocre camera hardware , etc"
"ZTE Blade 3, laggy shiiit"
"A21s, good battery, everything else was horrible"
Note 4
"Anything with older Mediatek & Exynos chips, they are horrendous"
LG Optimus V. It was the virgin mobile variant. It was terrible. The screen would just lock up if you did more than type 5 words. Although the one I had at least had physical buttons. I had a friend who had the Verizon version and it had capacitive buttons and if that thing locked up you had to take the battery out. Useless
"OnePlus One. The first mistake was expecting a fake startup to be even remotely ethical. The second was thinking its ""flagship killer"" would be anything other than a steaming pile of shit that basically self-destructed in 6 months. At least the textured backing was nice."
BlackBerry Storm
For me it was the iPhone.
Got my mom a Walgreens LG prepaid android years ago. My know-it-all brother went and loaded the 16 gigs storage with a bunch of apps thinking it's a flagship. Almost killed the thing.
I had an Oki 900 thing was a tank! I miss those days when phones were phones
"The Pixel 7. It has such poor network connectivity with both cellular and Wi-Fi. It switches to cellular in places where my OnePlus 8 Pro shows 3 WiFi bars. And then, it remains out of 4G/5G network with just 1 bar where 8 Pro shows full network. It struggles with calls and internet browsing both."
Iphone
Samsung Z flip 4
"HTC One M9. Thing overheated like a toaster and the battery life was garbage. Looked nice, but that was about it."
"My first smartphone, a Huawei Ascend Y, which I owned in late 2012.  It had 120mb of onboard storage, and I was always having to delete apps.  A few months later, I got an iPhone 5.  The phone put me off Android, but I'm glad that I decided to try a better Android phone later."
"Google Pixel 3 (which could trigger you by your username, OP :D).

I loved the camera for the time, I loved the software experience, I loved the build quality.

But it *never, ever* worked without issues. Never. Random freezes, even shutdowns. Randomly closing apps. It was just very unreliable and a pain to use as a daily driver. I really liked the device, so I returned the first one and got another one instead, which was better for a few months, but then that also started to act up the same way.

Runner-up is the HTC One M9. I loved HTC phones around 2010, had the Desire HD, the One S, the One X, the One M7, and then the One M9. The One M7 is my all time favorite smartphone I ever had, and the Desire HD was outstandingly great at its time, so I had high hopes. But it had insane thermal issues, it got hot in my hand while doing just slightly heavier tasks. If I wanted to game, it throttled and had performance issues while being almost burning hot. Other than the heat-related things, the camera was mediocre (the M7 wasn't strong in that regard neither, but this camera was super slow and just unimpressive in all ways), it was a bit too heavy, and battery life was mid. I refused to hate it because I knew it's probably the last HTC flagship, and I loved the brand, but it really wasn't a good device. At least it worked though, unlike the Pixel 3."
Windows phone
Pixel 8. Overheating
Worst galaxy z flip 3 close second would be LG G4
Apple iPhone
Galaxy S22 Ultra Exynos (that thing was portable stove) and battery eater
"I had the GSM version RAZR xt910 and overall it was great. Really slim. Survived lots of falls. But hadn't I known of XDA forums I would have sold it.

 It's greatest flaw was the plain android of most Motorolas.. hardware that couldn't shine due to settings. Just a ""1"" in a settings file and it had better video support. 

Update and Custom roms available. But saddly that meant losing the Swype keyboard that was one of the best keyboards."
The Galaxy Trend back in 2010 ish was pretty garbo
Iphone 6. Was my 2nd and last iphone.
"Sony Xperia Ultra first generation, just snapped out of nowhere"
One+ 8(?)
"So far worst to date is Pixel 9, which comes with the worst return process and customer service. I'm 62 and have had many phones, but this is by far the worst. Apps not opening, screen freezes. Emails vanishing..."
"Lumia. It seemed like the next best thing, It turned out a huge disappointment."
[removed]
"If we were to classify it as a smartphone (rather yes, as it was already the 2008-09 period), it would be the Samsung i900 Omnia. The phone looks nice, but the screen... A TORTURE! The resistive screen display rarely responded to touch. It also answered calls on its own. The worst and at the same time one of the prettiest phones. "
[removed]
"Nokia X2.


Out of 27 phones I've had till now, the Nokia X2 was probably the worst. It lagged as hell and had a terrible app store with barely any apps (it ran a forked version of Android 4.2, without Google Services). The camera quality was jaggy, plus the microphone was VERY muffled, too. The only good thing was the design and its bright orange color - that was a lovely color!


Three months in, I accidentally dropped it in the pool. Best day ever!"
[removed]
The Galaxy s21. Just inferior to the s10e in every way.
[deleted]
I needed a tie over phone and got the Huawei p8 lite after I was done with it I think I broke it that phone was the worst by far was very slow over heated lagged
"I still have s21 exynos, changed the battery, still have a problem to go through a day without charging :(

I hope s26 will have the new carbon silicone battery with faster charging, maybe I will switch then

If not, time to find another model"
I hear that generation of Galaxy S phones were underwhelming. It's really a shame because the S8-S10 generations were so good.
Yeah same except it was s10e. I bought iphone 15 pro after that and the battery difference is big
My s25 ultra is the same lol
"Oh hey, this happened to my Nexus 5X on the second day of my vacation to Prague. I had to fumble my way to a Vodafone store and buy some cheap Huawei phone so I could continue my trip. Basically everything was through my phone - reservations, maps, tickets - so I was crippled without it.


However, when I got back home, Google actually replaced the phone for me even though it was out of the warranty period. I kept it going for a couple of years after that, finally switching to a Galaxy S9+, which was a great phone for the five years I kept it."
"Whaaat?! 

The nexus was my favorite phone. I do think it was a 4 and by the time I needed a new one, it was no longer around, pixel was the takeover. 
Pixel 4 was great but the 7 has been the worst phone I've ever had"
"LG fixed mine and it lasted another year or so. It was a good phone in the sense it was native Android. I came from the horrid early Samsungs and vowed never to go in that direction again. Ended up with simple Moto phones for a while then went to an LG V60 for a few years. Same issue there, good phone but major hardware flaws. On Pixel now."
Yeah I know that was around the time of the infamous LG G4 bootlooping issues. Say mid 2010s.
Man I'm so sorry to hear that. What did you switch to afterwards?
Thank you for sharing! I never had any of Sony's phones before.
I had it and never really had any issue. Any chance you’d remember what was wrong with it ? (Out of curiosity)
"I've only had two LG phones. The LG Ally 3G which was my very first smartphone (2010-2011) and the LG G2 (2014-2015) I really liked both phones but sadly my G2 didn't last long 😭 
That would be my last LG phone"
"I had this phone also on Virgin Mobile also!


I rooted it and found some custom ROM that made the phone usable that thing was full of bloatware."
I never had a Windows phone. I kinda wish they were still around just to challenge iOS and Android. Competition is good.
Yeah battery life on the SE models were never a strong suit
Crying while writing this on my iPhone SE 2🥲🥲✌️
"That was my first android phone and aside from the battery life it was great, I think the first phone that was capable of 4G? But the battery...wow. you mentioned 8 hours, which is what I would get if I checked texts once or twice an hour. I'd be lucky to get 4 hours of moderate use, and always needed to be near an outlet. I sometimes watched the battery tick down as I was writing a message. I guess it was due to the unoptomized hardware the handle 4G, but that was just a rumor I read on forums back then."
"I loved the Thunderbolt soo much. Back when MetroPCS was its own CDMA carrier, I flashed it myself from VZW. It had a great screen on it but I could never get it to use 3G. Just 1X data and omg it was SLOOOOOW, but usable."
The Thunderbolt was my wife's first smartphone. I still remember the windshield wiper on the weather app. Phones have come a long way
I heard a lot about that phone but I never had any of the HTC products before. My very first 4G LTE phone was the Motorola Droid Bionic.
"I was buying new batteries once a month because my thunderbolt was completely killing them, like they would not charge or turn on."
Thank you so much for sharing. I appreciate you sharing your experience.
"Yep, I had one too. It was cool at first but the novelty wore off really fast. Still considered one of the biggest disasters in smartphone history."
I heard about the BlackBerry Storm. I never had any BlackBerry phones but I did hear how bad that one was.
I almost upgraded from my beloved Pixel 2XL to the Pixel 6 but decided to wait another year for the Pixel 7 series. I'm looking to upgrade again to the 11 series next year hopefully. So far both Pixel phones have been outstanding for me in terms of reliability and performance.
"Had the pixel 6 pro, it sucked.  The modem in that thing was awful, stuck with TSMC made Qualcomm after that"
I loved my G2 but mine malfunctioned way too soon and I would've gotten the G3 but I decided to go with the Galaxy S6 and looking back I'm glad I did
"Fellow Google phone user here 💪🏿
I've been team Pixel since owning my beloved Pixel 2XL which I had for 5 years. I never had a phone that long. It worked flawlessly the whole time I had it. I now have the Pixel 7 which I've had since launch and it's been rock solid for almost 3 years now. I'm hooked on Google's software and I don't see myself going with any other phones for the foreseeable future. I'm planning to upgrade to the Pixel 11 series next year hopefully and this time I want the Pro XL model."
Oh the bend gate phone?
What has been your worst one yet?
I so wish my G2 was stable. I loved that phone. It was one of the best phones I've used when it worked properly. I'm pretty bummed that it didn't last longer.
"I had a Photon, probably one of my most fondest phones I had.

Worst phone I had was a 13 Pro Max. iOS keyboard is horrible and had baseband issues, so I would lose service. Cell calling is completely dead even if I pay the debt to unlock it. Cant even update iOS as it needs the baseband to do so..."
My Flip 3 lasted about 5 months. :( Took them 8 months to refund me.
Man that's terrible 😕
"I heard how infamous the BlackBerry Storm was for the wrong reasons lol. 

I also heard how legendary the HTC One M8 was. I never had a chance to use any HTC products before they went away unfortunately"
Man that sounds like a nightmare!
"Oh wow that brings back memories. The kind of phone you'd lose in your pocket, even if you don't have anything else there!"
Thank you for sharing.
Yeah I don't know what happened with the S20 and Note 20 generation. Samsung definitely wasn't on the top of their game with that series
Oh my goodness!!! That sounds super limiting lol.
"I really wanted my LG G2 to last a lot longer than it did. I really liked that phone. I'm really bummed both of my models were defective 😞 sadly that was the last LG I've owned. Ironically my very first smartphone was the LG Ally 3G (Verizon edition) and it was a great phone. It had a slide out keyboard, 4 physical buttons and two capacitive buttons along the bottom of the screen. It was a great introduction into Android for me. 

I never owned any of Asus products but am curious about them."
Hey that's not bad at all. I actually like what they're doing with their phones now. Especially since around 2022 or so.
My only experience with a ZTE phone is one that my ex had way back in 2014. It was a budget phone through Cricket Wireless. Unfortunately I don't recall the model. I know  they have since ceased to be sold here in the US (at least as far as I know)
I hate that I didn't get a chance to experience the HTC One M8 (or any HTC phone for that matter) before they left the industry. Back then I wasn't paying much attention to the phone market. I feel the same about Nexus phones. I wish I would've picked one up back then. By the time I started following the phone market closely the OG Pixel was out and Nexus phones were no more. I had the LG G2 and the Samsung Galaxy S6 at the time before switching to my beloved Pixel 2XL in the fall of 2017. I've been hooked on Pixels ever since.
"Oh wow! I'm highly honored to have you post your thoughts here. Thank you for all you do! 

Like yourself, the Pixel 2XL was my very first Pixel phone and it was responsible for making me a Pixel fan for the foreseeable future. I've had that phone for 5 years and it worked flawlessly the whole time I had it. I didn't have a single issue with that phone performance wise. I upgraded to my current Pixel 7 which I've had since launch and almost 3 years later it's still rocking along pretty well. I'm looking to upgrade to the Pixel 11 series next year hopefully. I want to go with the Pro XL version this time around."
Awesome publication.
I heard the Pixel 4 and 4XL had poor battery life. Great phones but bad battery. I had my beloved Pixel 2XL at the time. I upgraded to my current Pixel 7 after owning the 2XL for 5 years (2017-2022)
"I appreciate it dude! Please feel free to inbox me anytime. I'm always open. 
I'll be looking out for the article. I'm subscribed."
"I'm a lifelong Android user and only had two Apple products: the OG iPod touch which ironically was my very first touchscreen device, and my current iPad 10 Gen which I really like to use around the house. But when it comes to phones, I'm Android all the way. 

The only Samsung I owned was the Galaxy S6 which I only had for 2 years. It was a decent phone and the processor remained snappy the whole time I had it but the battery life was horrible about a year into owning it. 

Before that phone I had two Motorola phones and two LG phones. 

Since switching from the S6 to my beloved Pixel 2XL I've been team Pixel ever since and I don't see myself getting any other phones for the foreseeable future. I love their software, though I do admit they can do better in the hardware department."
"Man that's understandable! I remember Adam Matlock (Tech Odyssey) which is a channel I'm subscribed to on YouTube had the same issue  with it. 
I never owned an iPhone as I'm a lifelong Android user. The only way I would ever own one is if it was given to me as a secondary device lol. I don't mind iOS when it comes to the iPad but for mobile I'm definitely Android all the way lol."
"I'm a lifelong Android user, but I remember when Windows phones were around, I was really curious about them but I never pulled the trigger. Back then I wasn't really paying much attention to the phone industry but looking back I really do wish they would've stuck around and succeeded only for competition sake. I want there to be a 3rd major OS around to challenge iOS and Android. 

I've only had one Samsung phone and that was the Galaxy S6 which I had for 2 years before upgrading to my beloved Pixel 2XL. I remember the S6 was a pretty decent phone with the exception of the horrible battery life about a year into owning it. But during that time the original Pixel came out and I was immediately drawn to the concept of receiving regular software updates and security patches. Plus the clean software really drew me in, so I decided to hold out for the 2XL a year later and boy I'm glad I did. That was the best phone I've ever owned. I had it for 5 years which is the longest I've ever kept a phone and it remained flawless performance wise the whole time I had it. The only issues I had with it was the screen was way too dim in direct sunlight. But man I loved that phone. I upgraded to the Pixel 7 at launch and it's been solid for almost 3 years now, but I don't really like the inconsistency of the fingerprint scanner and sometimes I feel the battery life isn't as good as it could be, but it's DEFINITELY not the worst I had by any stretch of the imagination (I'm looking at you Motorola Droid Razr 🧐) 

I plan to keep it another year and upgrade to the Pixel 11 series and this time I'm going with the Pro XL variant."
"I never had the opportunity to try any of the HTC phones before they left the industry. Back then I had mainly LG and Motorola Droid phones. By the time I finally started paying close attention to the phone industry, HTC was already on the decline unfortunately. I hear how everyone loved the HTC One M8. Probably a top 5 phone of all time."
Thank you so much for sharing! So you were basically there from the beginning. I didn't jump into the Android (let alone the smartphone) world until the Android Froyo days with the LG Ally 3G (2010)
Yeah the G2 was a really good phone. That's why I was so bummed when it glitched out after only 8 months of owning it. It was super unfortunate because it was one of my favorite phones 😔
Thank you so much for sharing your experience. Unfortunately I never got a chance to use any of Sony's phones when they were officially sold in my country. It seems like they are pretty neat phones.
Dang 😮 lol
Thank you so much for sharing! I remember those earlier Xcover devices. I'm a lifelong Android user but I've only had one Samsung phone and that was the Galaxy S6 which I had for 2 years. It was a good phone but my only issue with it near the end of my time with it was the horrible battery life. I then upgraded to my beloved Pixel 2XL which was my very first Google phone and I've been team Pixel ever since. I absolutely LOVED that phone. I had it for 5 years and it worked flawlessly the entire time I had it. I upgraded to my current Pixel 7 which I got at launch and it's been rock solid for me for almost 3 years now.
"Yeah the early 2010s were not a good time for many Android phones. Boy that's definitely not the case these days lol. Outside of the Droid Razr and the G2 all of my phones have been pretty reliable and stable. My beloved Pixel 2XL which was my first Google device lasted 5 years and it remained flawless the whole time I had it. I've now had my Pixel 7 for almost 3 years and not a single issue as of yet. My Galaxy S6 which I had before the 2XL was pretty solid as well, it just had horrible battery life."
Man thank you so much for sharing! Yeah I'm with you on that. I do wish Windows phones and BlackBerry were still around. I think it's good to have at least a 3rd major OS available.
Yep it counts. Thank you for sharing!
"I liked that phone, you could mod the phone to do some cool things....when it worked."
I was so sad when I couldn't get a replacement Bionic. The battery life was really good and it was a great phone for the time. It was actually my first 4G LTE phone.
"I just made a post asking about Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo, Honor, and Post US-banned Huawei phones since I have no experience with any of their products since they aren't officially sold here in the US."
Thank you for sharing!
Yeah unlucky with those other issues but i had that camera issue on mine as well
What did you go to afterwards?
"I’ve been using the 14 Pro Max for the last 2 years and love it, sorry to hear about your experience 👍🏻 iPhones are way too expensive to be giving issues like that"
Man that sounds painful 😬
How long did you have it?
I never owned any blackberry phones as I didn't enter the smartphone era until mid 2010. I've been a lifelong Android user. I do wish they were still around though with updating hardware
Yeah it's a shame what happened with the Note 7. Arguably one of the most gorgeous phones ever made. But yeah Samsung screwed up on that one big time.
Thank you for sharing! 🙂
What a piece of crap the nexbit robin was lmao
"I'm a lifelong Android user but I've only had one Samsung phone and that was the Galaxy S6. I had it for two years and while the processor remained snappy, I grew tired of receiving updates late and having duplicate apps (now mind you this was before the One UI days). I switched to my beloved Pixel 2XL at launch and I've been team Pixel ever since. I prefer Google's software approach more."
S10 was the *best* phone I ever owned!
It seems people loved that phone. What issues did you have with it?
I've never owned an iPhone but I have an iPad and I don't mind iOS when it comes to that. But when it comes to Mobile I have always preferred Android. Especially Pixel phones. I like Google's software approach the best.
Why do you dislike it?
Thank you for sharing! I heard the LG G4 phones had the bootlooping issues too back in the day.
"I used to own a Xiaomi Mi A2 Lite that had a Custom Rom on it, i no longer have it anymore + i also had an Honor 8X"
"That was my best phone ever and still is a i continue to use it. 


I switched it out as my daily driver 5 years and one battery swap later only because of some screen burn in at the notification bar. "
The best phones I ever had.
"Your account is too young. Please wait at least 5 days to begin posting.

"How, could you explain more?"
Aww man. Well at least it wasn't your primary device at the time.
"Oh man, I'm sorry to hear that. So far I've been fortunate with the two Pixel phones I've had. My Pixel 2XL worked flawlessly for all 5 years I had it and then I upgraded to my current Pixel 7 at launch and it's been rock solid for almost 3 years now. But I do know Google has had issues with their quality control. Something they definitely need to tighten up on. Looks like they've made some strides with the current 9 series though."
What issues did you have with it? I've never owned an Asus device before
"Dang man that's so messed up 😤
How long did you have it?"
Whoa! I'm really shocked to see this particular iPhone mentioned here.
😭 I absolutely LOVED my Pixel 2XL
"Oddly enough, in my experience the two Pixels I've had so far (Pixel 2XL and Pixel 7) have been the best two phones I've ever owned. I got my Pixel 2XL on Black Friday 2017 and didn't upgrade until my current Pixel 7 in October 2022. It works flawlessly the whole time I had it. I didn't have a single issue with that phone performance wise. I only upgraded to my current Pixel 7 due to the battery being highly degraded by that time and also Google stopped supporting it two years prior to the time I upgraded. My Pixel 7 is almost 3 years old and it's been rock solid in my experience. 

But I do agree that Google does need to do better with their hardware quality. I think with the Pixel 9 series they really stepped it up, but they do still have some ways to go to really go to the next level."
Man that's horrible! Thank you for sharing 🙂
What issues did you have with it?
I've never had the chance to use a Huawei phone before they were banned here in the US. How was the experience software wise?
Thank you for sharing 🙂
Yeah I heard even the Snapdragon version of the S22 wasn't the best when it came to battery. If I'm not mistaken that was the generation that came with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chip that has heating issues. Just wasn't a good generation of Galaxy S phones all around I guess.
Do you remember which generation?
The Motorola Droid Bionic was my first 4G LTE phone. I so wish I would've had it longer. I probably would've kept it for at least 3 years. I got it in late 2011.
Wow that's really surprising. What issues have you had with the 16? I'm curious
Was that your first iPhone?
I heard the original was even worse.
"This is why when it comes to mobile I've always preferred Android. I don't mind the iPad or even the MacBook, but I just could never get into iPhones. I have a 10th Gen iPad that I love using around the house, but that's the only extent I can tolerate iOS."
What issues did you have with it?
I heard that chip had some issues. Kinda reminds me of the infamous Snapdragon 810 but not as bad.
Do you recall which generation?
"I had the previous generation, LG G2 and I loved that phone, but man it just didn't last long for me. The screen went absolutely HAYWIRE and it just became unusable. Ghost touches galore. I'm really bummed about it because when it worked, it was a great phone."
"Man that's horrible 😯
Thank you for sharing!"
"I've only had two LG phones. They were actually pretty fun phones but after the G4 they really lost their focus and direction and just couldn't get back to prominence. 

That's sad to hear how your G6 performed."
"Oh WOW! I'm really surprised to see this phone mentioned here. It seems the majority of people love that phone. I'm really shocked 😮
I'm sorry to hear you had such a hard time with it"
What issues did you have with it?
Ohh yeah I remember that was a huge deal back then. This was right around the time I started to really pay close attention to what was going on in the phone industry. That was a disaster
I remember when ZTE sold cheaper phones here in the US. I haven't seen one in at least 10 years or so.
What issues did you have with it?
Still own mine. Keep it as a portable emulation machine. I rocked it as a daily driver late last year after my main phone died. Held up well.
Which one?
"Oh wow, I'm surprised to see this phone mentioned here lol. Thank you for sharing 🙂"
Someone else mentioned this phone as well. They said their S2 died after only a year. What issues did you have with yours?
I remember when that phone came out. It wasn't until a few years later when I really started paying close attention to the phone market that I remember hearing how that phone was.
I just knew in the couple of minutes with one in-store that I would hate the Storm. I loved my blackberrys but the Torch was an abomination and still to date the only phone I've returned.
I remember hearing about the issues with that phone. I honestly wish BlackBerry and Windows phones stuck around just to provide competition for Android and iOS. It's sad we only have two major OS around today.
"Thank you for sharing! I missed out on HTC phones when they were around. I had mostly LG and Motorola Droid phones at the time. By the time I really started paying attention to the phone industry HTC was unfortunately on their way out. 

Also I have no experience with Xiaomi phones since they aren't sold in my country. But I hear a lot about them. 

What is your current phone?"
Thank you for sharing. I only had 2 LG phones. The LG Ally 3G which was my very first smartphone (2010-2011) and the LG G2 (2014-2015) both were good phones but sadly my G2 malfunctioned way too soon and became unusable after only 8 months. I loved that phone so I was bummed I had to move on
Lol is that the original Mega? I remember only learning about this phone line very recently. What issues did you have with it?
"Thank you for sharing! I never had an HTC phone nor a Windows phone. Back when they were around I wasn't paying much attention to the phone industry so I missed out on many of the reviews. 

What issues did you have with them? I'm curious."
Man I'm so sorry to hear that. I have the standard Pixel 7 which I got at launch. I really wanted to get the 7 Pro but I wasn't comfortable with having a curved display so I went with the regular 7 instead. So far it's been pretty solid for me with no issues except the fingerprint scanner and sometimes less than ideal battery life. But software wise it's been great. I'm looking forward to upgrading to the Pixel 11 series next year though because I want a TSMC made Tensor chip and I want a bigger display this time around.
Yeah I feel you on that! I had the S6 at the time and this is what made me switch to the Pixel 2XL. I grew tired and frustrated with the slow updates and the duplicate apps. Ever since switching to Pixel phones I've been happy with their software approach. I now have the Pixel 7 which is my 2nd Pixel device in 8 years. Both phones have been great for me. I do plan to upgrade to the Pixel 11 series next year hopefully.
Do you remember which BlackBerry model you had?
"Thank you so much for sharing! I've always been curious about OEMs like Honor that aren't officially sold here in the US. I've never experienced any Huawei, Honor, Xiaomi, Oppo, or Vivo phones before. So this is really interesting to me."
"I heard many people had issues with that phone. I've had mine since launch and it's been rock solid for me. But I've also had a great experience with my beloved Pixel 2XL which I upgraded from after owning it for 5 years and it remained flawless performance wise the whole time I had it. 

Sorry to hear you had a bad experience."
Whoa!!! I'm super surprised to see this phone mentioned here. What issues do you have with it?
"Thank you for sharing! I'm a lifelong Android user but I've only had one Samsung phone and that was the Galaxy S6 which I had from 2015-2017. Afterwards I switched to my first Google phone which was my beloved Pixel 2XL that I had from Black Friday 2017-2022 and it was the first phone I can truly say I absolutely LOVED. I didn't have a single issue with that phone and I fell in love with Google's clean software and timely and consistent updates. I now have the Pixel 7 which I got at launch and it's been rock solid for me so far. I'm looking to upgrade to the Pixel 11 series next year hopefully and this time I'm going for the Pro XL model because I want a bigger display and battery. Plus I'm looking forward to having a TSMC made Tensor chip. 

The other phones I've had are the following: 

1. LG Ally 3G Verizon (2010-2011) this was my first smartphone. 

2. Motorola Droid Bionic (2011-2012) (see my post for explanation lol)

3. Motorola Droid Razr (2012-2014) 😤

4. LG G2 (2014-2015) 💔😭

5. Samsung Galaxy S6 (2015-2017)

 Not bad but just had bad battery life near the end of my time with it. But the processor remained pretty snappy for me."
"The RAZR was a good phone for the first few months I had it, but then that processor and battery life started giving me major problems. By the time I moved on from it, it was SUPER slow."
That was the issue I had with my LG G2. It literally became unusable because the screen just kept shifting and glitching out randomly. It was bad. I hated it because I really liked that phone but it just wasn't worth keeping it anymore.
I'm so surprised to see this phone mentioned here 😮 it seems the majority of people love that phone. Wow 😮
Which one?
"I'm not an iPhone person, but I believe the 13 Pro Max was probably the best iPhone Apple has ever made. That whole 13 series was pretty solid from top to bottom. 

I almost upgraded from my beloved Pixel 2XL to the Pixel 6 but decided to wait a year later for the Pixel 7. Glad I did. I'm looking forward to upgrading to the Pixel 11 series next year hopefully"
"Thank you for sharing. I never had a Nokia smartphone before, but I did have one of their flip phones back when I was in high school and I loved it."
The original one?

I really like Google's software approach more than Samsung's, because of its clean software and consistent updates. I know Samsung has gotten MUCH better since One UI was introduced and their software updates have gotten significantly better, but man there's just something about how Google does their software that makes it hard for me to choose another brand. I've now had my Pixel 7 since launch and it's been solid for me for almost 3 years now. I do plan to upgrade to the Pixel 11 series next year hopefully."
Oh wow how long have you had it?

The only ZTE phones I knew were the ones that were sold by Cricket and other MVNOs here in the States about 10-12 years ago or so. Never had one though
Thank you for sharing. What phone did you go to afterwards?
I'm surprised to see this phone mentioned here. It seems like  the Galaxy Note 4 was a pretty popular phone. What issues did you have with it?
It seems Mediatek has come a long way. Especially the last two years or so.
"Oh man that sounds horrible 😕 
I had two LG phones. The first one was the LG Ally 3G (Verizon) which was my very first smartphone. It had a slide out keyboard, 4 physical buttons along the bottom of the screen (power, home, menu, call) and two capacitive buttons (back and search). I really liked that phone. I also had the LG G2 which was one of my favorite phones to use... until suddenly it just completely glitched out. The screen became  completely useless after only 8 months. I was bummed because I really liked that phone."
Oh wow that's crazy. I never had a OnePlus phone before. The first OnePlus phone I remember was the OnePlus 3 series which came out around the time I began to really pay attention to the phone industry. Always been curious about them.
I hear how infamous the problems were with that phone.
Thank you for sharing. Which one?
Oh my goodness! That's crazy. How long did she keep it?
"I understand that. That's fair because I know Google didn't use the best modem for that phone. Fortunately I've had mine since launch and it has been pretty solid for me. However, I'm looking to upgrade to the Pixel 11 series next year. I'm hoping Google switches from Exynos modems, although the ones that were in the 8 and 9 are better. But we'll see"
Which one?
Thank you for sharing. What issues did you have with it?
Man that's awful. I never had an HTC phone but I hear how great the previous One M8 was though.
"Yeah unfortunately many iPhone users judge all of Android based on cheap models. They assume that Android is the same as it was 10+ years ago. But I'm glad you gave it another chance lol. 

I never owned a Huawei phone. By the time I learned what they were, they were banned here in the States about a year later or so. It's unfortunate."
"Lol hey it's all good. Am I a Pixel fan, yes indeed and I'm not ashamed to admit it. But I also know everyone has different experiences with different phones. Plus I try to be as objective as possible regardless of the brand. I like Google's software the best but I know they don't have the best hardware. For that, I admire a lot of the Chinese brands for their hardware. 

In my personal experience, the two Pixel phones I've had so far have been the best devices I ever used. I had my beloved Pixel 2XL for 5 years and it worked flawlessly the whole time I had it. I never kept a phone that long and the only reason I upgraded to my current Pixel 7 at launch was because Google stopped supporting it and the battery life was highly degraded by the end of my time with it, which is expected. So far my Pixel 7 has been solid for almost 3 years now with little to no issues. These have been the best devices I've ever used software wise. I do hope Google continues to improve their hardware though."
I never had a chance to try any of the windows phones.
"Man I'm so sorry to hear that. My Pixel 7 has been pretty solid and I have had it since launch. However, I do look forward to upgrading to the Pixel 11 series next year though due to the hardware. I want a TSMC made Tensor chip"
Did your G4 have the bootlooping issue? I heard that was a common issue with that phone.
Thanks for sharing. Any particular model?
Man I'm so sorry. What did you go to afterwards?
I do remember the keyboard being really good but man that phone just didn't hold up well for me at all. I actually still have it in the drawer though lol.
Thank you for sharing! 2010 was the year I got my very first smartphone. It was the LG Ally 3G (Verizon)
"Oh wow, what issues did you have with it?"
Oh wow 😳 that's crazy!

To me the S8-S10 generations were peak Samsung
I unfortunately never had a chance to experience an HTC phone before they disappeared. I hear the HTC One M8 was legendary
One of my favorite phones crazy to see it on this list
"That sounds horrible 😕 
How long did you have it and what did you go with afterwards?"
"That's the sort of problem companies run into when they implement proprietary solutions instead of paying the licensing fees to vendors with well-established tech. Companies that use the Snapdragon SoC in their devices have to pay Qualcomm licensing fees. To reduce production costs, Samsung used their own Exynos SoC in some markets. Unfortunately, the proprietary solutions are often inferior. Case in point: Oneplus uses proprietary audio tech in the OP13 instead of licensing Dolby Atmos. The result was inferior sound quality as compared to other flagships that use Dolby."
"No, it was a great generartion, but the Exynos' terrible standby drain ruined it for affected regions"
"yeah, S10 Exynos was godly. I could still use it today with minimal complaint but somehow they messed up the standby drain on S20."
S20 fe 5g (with Quallcomm) was one of my contenders for my best device ever.
Galaxy S8 Exynos was awful
"Never used the E model, but S10 is still going strong for me. It's my backup phone and can easily do a full day of my usage with original battery."
really? Damn! Never had an ultra as they are a bit too big for me. Coworker has a S22 Ultra Exynos and says it barely manages a day so would have thought it would be a breeze for a 25 Ultra.
"To me the Galaxy S7-S10 generations were peak Samsung. Those were special phones for sure. I had the S6 and went to the Pixel 2XL afterwards so I missed out on those phones, but from afar I really liked those generations"
I unfortunately never got a chance to use any of the Nexus phones because back when they were around I wasn't paying much attention to the Smartphone industry as I do now so I was unaware of the different models. It wasn't until around 2016 when I started to really gain a huge interest in the smartphone market. I had the Galaxy S6 at the time and the original Google Pixel was out that year and I began to be interested in Pixel phones because of the day 1 updates. So I decided to wait a year and got the 2XL which was my very first Google device and it changed the game for me. Fortunately I've had good experiences with both my 2XL and my current 7 which I've had for almost 3 years now.
I loved my Nexus 4. That phone was fun. You could mod it and do so many things with it. I also agree the pixel 7 was absolutely terrible
"Man it's so unfortunate what happened with LG. Their phones were some of the most fun models I've used. I just wish they were more consistent. I guess LG redeemed itself greatly when I got my Pixel 2 XL since they were the ones who manufactured that legendary beast of a phone. But by that time I became hooked on Pixels and never looked back to either Samsung, Motorola, or LG."
Weird but my lg v20 was and continues to be my best phone ever. 
iPhone 16 pro max and I couldn’t be happier with it. The last iPhone I had before this was an iPhone 5 and looking back I also absolutely loved that.
"Heyy. Good to know someone who used that phone. I don't remember all the problems i had but some that i still remember are :

- the navigation buttons very not very responsive. The transparent light bar was cool but the buttons were awkwardly placed and needed muktiple tappings

- wobbled like an unbalanced boat. Those were pre-case days so there was no solution for that

- the camera button. When I picked up my 16 pro max, i had a chuckle because this phone has a similarly unusable camera button. The camera in general was impressive and i bought the phone because of the camera memories from school days when sony ericsson used to have top cameras."
"Man I really enjoyed it, I just wish it would've been more reliable. It's sad what happened to it."
It was clunky.
"rip

bro upgrade."
What are you planning to upgrade to next?
Yeah that's definitely possible. It was the early years of 4G and OEMs didn't have the hardware to handle the power. Especially batteries back then
"Oh my goodness, that sounds so frustrating 😕"
I had almost every pixel phones but this one sucked lol. Bought the 9 and it's a good one!
And it was expensive.
Awww man I forgot about the G2. That thing was awesome and had an amazing camera
Bent the first week.
I only have experience with a couple of the older Pixel phones. No real experience otherwise.
Oh wow I'm actually surprised to see the 13 Pro Max mentioned on here. It seems like it was one of the best iPhones Apple has ever made.
Smh inexcusable! 😤
😂😂😂
"I have a ZTE flip phone that I used last year, and it's miles better than that blackberry-esque one I described above. This flip phone has had crystal clear calls, and does exactly what I needed it to. The standby battery life is like two weeks, too.

Even got it ""new"" through eBay. Ah well, live and learn."
The couple pixels with their two-tone back colors were definitely cool looking . I'm currently using a pixel 9 pro and it's quite a good device I haven't had any thing or any problems with it at all.
"Yeah, I've always loved the capabilities with Android. iPhone is just a phone that works, and has a good camera and long software support. That's really the only thing that it has going for it. But the recent iPhones have been a disappointing experience for me. Even so, I still think the XS and 11 are the best iPhones. My RedMagic 10 Pro has an amazing battery, it easily lasts me 2 days with normal usage, and maxed out everything, and 3 days if I turn off 5G, and turn the refresh rate down to 90hz. It never lags or freezes up on me, and it's instant as soon as I click something. It doesn't have the annoying animation delay that iOS has."
"Aaaah that was the golden era of phones there were new stuff in every next phone whenever we bought a new phone excitement was off the charts. HTC brought new beautiful interactive sense UI around 2007-2010 era and it felt really high tech during this time until iPhones went main stream. Samsung brought amoled in s 1 and every one was criticizing apple for LCD panels. HTC also introduced best weather widget and animations of rain on whole screen in the phones like HTC desire hd2 ..desire HD wildfire etc. HTC one M8 was ahead of its time with bigger battery beautiful design exceptional audio DAC , sound quality and stereo speakers (rare feature at that time) and 1080 p display and not to forget ir blaster for remote control devices."
"This was also in 2010, I wasn't that much ahead 😄 The Spica was 2nd hand. Thinking back, the Android version I refreshed to was Eclair (2.1), rather than Froyo (2.2). It had a lot more features but made the phone painfully sluggish. I returned to the Android world in 2013 with a Galaxy S Plus and I used custom ROMs on that. The last version was probably Jelly Bean. I really liked when Android was desserts!"
"I have a pixel 7 now too. I like it's performance, but the battery is too weak for my taste. 
The Doogee I had before could do up to 4 days with everything on. That was nice. One day would be enough but my pixel barely manages that. 
I wish I could put Spotify on an old style phone. I'd leave the smart world for sure."
"I mean... they are all good brands
Im not saying Xiaomi makes bad cell phones
That one Xiaomi 12 was a piece of shit, 140$ cell phone, not even Samsung makes good phones in that range (Apple doesnt even try) 

Xiaomi has quite good phones, likewise those 3 other brands you mention

Anyways i agree with the other comment, in the US , Xiaomi is only compatible with Tmobile and a couple more. But coverage is not as good as for Samsung, Apple or Google.. so in the US. Its just not worth it to get one of the chinese brands"
"If you are in the US, do not get Xiaomi/Huawei/Oppo... because they are generally not compatible with US networks except for T-mobile because of carrier whitelisting. And even they might not have all the network bands even on flagship(top tier) models.

There are many Xiaomi fans who will continuously give bad advice to NA/US consumers that the phones are totally compatible. Had this problem for years on the Xiaomi sub. 

BBK(Oneplus/Oppo/Vivo) phones imo have better OS/UI stability. Xiaomi's UI/OS is more buggy but for their fans, its worth the tradeoff for the cheap price."
"I sold it and got the s24ultra but yea i literally wasted 15k on that 14pm.
That's very bad considering i m still in college"
"I had a 13 and 12 before that , But yeah i got unlucky with the 14pm"
Less than 1 year. It is currently a paperweight.
Your welcome
"i had 16gb storage model and it was nowhere close to being enough for its time

and also it uses iOS"
Idk why but all other phone manufactures are way ahead with everything unlike apple they present something old on android but its like first time use on ios
Lack of universal back gesture and keyboard are my biggest gripes. Especially the keyboard. Typing on iPhone is a torture while on Android is a pleasure. There are many minor issues as well.
"LG G4 Made me hate android for years, I tried Samsungs high end tablets and I still hated android 

It wasn’t till I tried one plus phones that’s the one I started to enjoy android again

And get this my main phone now is the pixel 9 along with my iPhone  cuz I still own Apple stuff"
Really? You must have had some really shit phones then.
"My family has Pixel 6, 6 pro, 7pro and 8 pro among us. So we still believe pixels are decent phones but that was a bad one in the mix to wholeheartedly go all out for Pixels"
"The issue was with the ZenUI was too heavy and everything lagged because of it. It was my first phone, had to sell it for a Le2 which was also bad as it had heating issues then I got a Redmi Note 4 which was perfect."
"Let's say the entire device hardware is subpar to be called a flagship , 

Do you know what happens if you use on your pixel a third party camera app ? Instead of the native ? That google algorithm goes to sleep , and you get the true image from the sensor , ( sucks big time , ) subpar  SOC , performance wise is pretty much behind on every aspect vs other flagships at the same price point ,

If I'm paying for a flagship I want an all around flagship ,

Latest battery tech ( silicon carbon ) real fast charging 80-120W , snapdragon 8 elite , dimensity 9400 , A18 , Sony lyt 900 , Samsung HP9 etc,

We're paying flagship price for mass collecting our data and we still get subpar specs ,

I'm not saying that apple or Samsung are better because they're playing by the same rule , 

""It is good enough ""  ,we don't need to change , and obviously don't , they're pretty much stagnant , releasing just minimal upgrades ,

But they're still using old ass hardware and tech on them , like the 25 ultra , ( fake glued camera rings ) or the brilliant idea of removing Bluetooth of the s-pen ?, while keeping the price or rising it , 

It sucks ,"
"never have problem with software, google and everything works just fine"
I had 53A phone died itself after 1 year use
Wouldn't surprise me if that was the case.
21 maybe 🤔
Phone was good Build quality wise and the 3d touch home button was fun to use. The software was hell though. I couldn't do 90% of the stuff i did with my old hand me down htc desire and nokia lumia. I mostly used my phone for media consumption at the time as i was only like 14 or 15 yo. Not being able to download anything (music and movies mostly) and no customization and no sharing stuff with my friends. I had to install this app called x sender i think to get songs from my friends. It was a nightmare. Other than that it was pretty good for social media etc but eh didn't really care much at the time. I only bought it thinking that I'd be able to jailbreak and do most of the stuff like my ipod touch but i couldn't figure it out at the time. Anyway no more apple after that. I don't want tim cook to tell me how i use my phone.
It got old
Yes
Really terrible cell phone reception. Spotty wifi. And general sluggishness. 
"My first phone was actually a Nokia 1100. It was absolutely indestructible and awesome lol.. My current phone is actually a pretty old phone, OnePlus 7T. It's been an amazing phone so far even after years of use. The camera is still pretty good, the phone is still fast since i don't overload the storage capacity. Battery is starting to show it's age. Once the battery gets to 20% it'll go to 10% and to 1% within a matter of a few minutes. Definitely looking to buy a new device soon. Debating between the OnePlus 13 and IPhone 16 Pro. What about you?"
"I didn't even really have major issues, it was just slow, and ran hot. I've maybe had worse phones, but I haven't had a worse flagship phone."
"My bad it was before that, the rokr not the razr"
Me too i was so excited. Great performance but the known issues with app killing is truly a deal breaker. Having the app reopen everytime you change app
2GB RAM. It hanged whenever I got a call. Imagine doing anything else with it
"I had the Samsung Vibrant on T-Mobile which was the first Galaxy phone. Was into running custom ROMs and that phone was one of my favorites. Later I had a Galaxy S5 that was bloated and miserable until I put a custom ROM that was much more like stock Android.

Then I had an s9 and felt they had toned it down enough that it wasn't worth flashing a new ROM on it. Never owned a pixel but I had a Nexus 6 briefly and several OnePlus devices back in the 1 through 5 days when it was very lightly skinned and liked those a well."
Going on my second year now. I'm just waiting till the 36th month so I can upgrade.
"To me my experience is subpar. , for something called a flagship"
Pixel 6 pro but now on a magic 7 pro
Battery would go 60 to 0 and shut down. I loved my note 3. And then looked forward to the note 5 until they took away the SD card. Then there was no reason not to switch back to Apple at the time.
They've improved alot but still Snapdragon is tad bit ahead
My wife had the G2 and that was a cool phone. The power and volume buttons on the back were great
"It was a pretty weird experience. Like everyone else who bought that first model, I was excited to get a high-end-ish phone for less money. The specs were really good for the time. But then the ""fun"" began. First, news came out that this ""startup"" was really just a division of Oppo (a big Chinese phone maker) with a 22 year old figurehead (Carl Pei, current CEO of Nothing) at the top. Then all sorts of issues started arising, with the company doing nothing to rectify them. When I finally got rid of it, the phone couldn't even make phone calls, because the microphones had stopped filtering out ambient noise.

I'm sure they're better now (how could they not be?). But that definitely left a bad taste in my mouth about both OnePlus and Carl Pei."
IPhone 13 I think.
She kept it for like 3 years iirc
All
"I went through 4 phones in two years between the screen not working, overheating to the point where I couldn't use it, the middle of the screen stopped working and it started to show screen burning and dead pixels. It wasn't ideal lol Great concept, poor execution. Now I'm using the Ultra 24"
"I'm also glad that I gave it another chance.  My second Android phone was a Galaxy S5, and it ended being my all-time favorite phone.  Before I got my piece of crap Huawei, I had wanted the Galaxy S3."
"Facts.  I see memes comparing the camera quality of iPhones and Androids, and it’s like they’re comparing an iPhone 16 Pro Max with a $99 Walmart Android from 2012."
Oh wow dude thank you for the reward!
Got one from my employer. Regretted it quickly.
"Yeah. And it was a real, problem for me, not just anecdotal. I fly drones. I once hooked it up to the remote controller of my drone. While flying, the DJI app crashed because my Pixel 8 became too hot. It was scary. I thought I was about to lose my drone."
Yes it did. But I was lucky that I didn't need to pay anything but it was still a pain and all my data was gone too.
"No particular model, just iPhone in general.  The model I've ever owned was an iPhone 4, but only because it was a work phone.  

Switched to Samsung and never looked back.  Though the phone that I absolutely loved was my Lumia Windows phone."
I went to Samsung S24 Ultra Snapdragon
"Basically? iOS. It's too limiting. A lot of things i take for granted now on android are either not a thing on iOS or EU has to force Apple to introduce them. Hell, you can completely degoogle android if you choose to do so, that's how much control you have (at least if you choose correct phone). You can't deapple iOS.  
Back in the day there was argument to pick apple due to better camera and screen, but it's no longer the case.

But my mother was using my iPhone 6 for years after i was done with it. Hell, she still has it and uses to play some dumb games."
Just laggy and overall terrible. 
[removed]
"It's sad that they failed later on, their early android models were mega!"
The one m8 was fantastic! I still miss it. 😢
I didn't have it for long something like a week to a month I can't remember if I smashed it or sold it I think I smashed it was years ago now
I didn't know that about the OnePlus 13. Very interesting 🤔
"That's a good point. Thankfully here in the US we had the Snapdragon versions. I just didn't like the S20 generation as much as the previous two generations. I think they were much better, design and feature wise."
"S10e exynos, battery drain really fast. Replaced with some knockoff, was great for 3 month, now discharges fast as well.

However, power saving mode extends life like 2-3 times."
I can only speak for the Snapdragon models. But I'm more so talking about the overall designs of those generations of Samsung. They were special
"Exynos phones often overheat, and Ultra phones aren't that big, although I understand your point. Personally, I'd prefer a flip phone. "
"Imo they were the golden era of smartphones. I can't remember exactly the models but LG made a nexus and Google made one, I believe the Google one was their first they manufactured themselves and there were differences in which android Software they used.

 The LG had a removable back plate while the Google was 1 piece. That Google nexus was the best phone I have ever had. The USB connector eventually failed as allllllll google phones do and i went for another nexus but they rebranded it as the pixel. I had the one that looked identical to iPhone at the time but had the round touch pad on the back.  This was my 2nd favorite and best phone.   Eventually tho, the usb failed and for whatever reason, it stopped letting me make/ take calls.   I could text no problem and do video call but it wouldn't function as a regular phone. 

Tried an iPhone again, then went back to pixel 7 and it has been frustrating and problematic. 

My biggest issue with Google phones, the Pixel lineup, it has problems connecting to PC via USB. This leaves it almost useless for me as unload mine up with music and video. It's a known issue that has effected multiple models as far back as the 6"
"I just can't believe or trust google with hardware.  Every phone has the same 2 issues and the fact they have problems being recognized on PC connection is absurd for a smartphone. 

 I like the 9a going back to being sleek and battery life has always seemed above normal for me but not being able to connect to my PC I can't deal with.  I don't do Spotify or subscription I download and store it like an iPod. 

I grabbed an s25 after the pixel 7. It's the perfect phone IMO in terms of size/ shape."
Had that one. The only complaint I'd say was the atrocious battery life.
I enjoyed the two LG phones I had. I'm just bummed out that my G2 didn't last. It was a great phone when it worked.
That's good to hear! Glad it's working well.
I had a Nokia Lumia and I enjoyed it but the lack of Play store really sucked and forced me to switch to an android.
Yeah I hear the 9 series is very solid. I'm excited to see what a TSMC made Tensor chip is going to do for the Pixel 10 series.
I hate that mine went bad so quickly. I could imagine keeping that phone for at least 2-3 years if it didn't. I liked that phone.
Man that's crazy smh 🙁
"I guess I just got extremely unlucky. It was my first iPhone as I always had Android. I was kinda slightly peer pressured by my family and partially curious how iPhone was.

Every now and then I have thoughts on going back to iPhone but then i remember its keyboard and then I don't want it anymore. Its that bad...

unless its free, probably won't get another iPhone."
It's amazing how much better phones have gotten over the years.
Yeah I kinda wish they went back to that to an extent. It definitely was unique. I'm looking to upgrade to the Pixel 11 series next year hopefully. This time I want to go with the Pro XL variant. I look forward to the TSMC made Tensor chips. I'm excited about the upcoming Pixel 10 series. But I think I'm gonna hold out another year
I really missed out. I think I remember seeing it in the Verizon store at the time too but for the life of me I don't know why I didn't choose it. Wish I could go back and tell my 2014 self to pick that phone over the LG G2 I had at the time 😅
Lol yeah it made it more memorable for sure.
"Yeah I agree, I'm a lighter user but I've noticed the battery life on my Pixel 7 isn't as good as the 2XL was. But it's certainly not the worst I had. I'm looking to upgrade to the Pixel 11 Pro XL next year hopefully. I want to go with the XL model this time because I want a bigger display and battery. I'm also looking forward to having a TSMC made Tensor chip too. I think that will be a big improvement in terms of efficiency."
I appreciate your insight man. Very informative. Thank you!
This is good information. I completely agree with everything you said. This is why I never was interested in owning any of Xiaomi's phones but I've always been curious about them. I'm glad OnePlus phones are interesting to me as well. I'm a Pixel user but I'm looking to get the OnePlus buds 3 one day.
Man I'm so sorry to hear you had such a bad experience. I currently have a Pixel 7 which I've had for almost 3 years and it's been great but I want to upgrade next year to the 11 Pro XL hopefully.
Dang man 🙁 that's crazy
"upon further thinking i have to change my answer to iphone 15 pro. it's another janky piece of shit. the damn thing gets hot to the touch after only a few minutes of running NOT resource-intensive apps

unlike the SE it lacks a 3.5mm jack therefore it is exponentially worse"
"Apple is a very conservative company. They're not known for pushing the envelope too much, but they wait until things are out for a while then use it later to ensure it works properly. I understand their approach even if I don't like Apple as a company."
My wife has the 13 and it's been stable for her. But I just never could get into iPhones. I don't mind iPads but when it comes to mobile I prefer Android
"Samsung Galaxy S3, S4, S5 Nokia 5 and Nokia 8 5G. The first one broke destroyed batteries yearly. the other had green tint after half a year. The 4th and 5th were just horribly slow and had no camera stabilizer"
"That's totally fair. I appreciate you sharing your thoughts on this, my friend. I enjoy talking about this stuff lol"
Thank you for sharing! I'm really curious now about Asus phones. I heard the Zenphone 10 was a good phone but I know that's more recent. Also Xiaomi phones aren't available in my country either. Glad the Redmi phone has been great for you 🙂
That's good to hear. I've always been curious about Huawei phones
Man that's awful 😬
Gotcha. Thank you for sharing 🙂
"I totally feel you on that. Ironically my very first touchscreen device was the original iPod touch I got my freshman year of college (fall 2009) but I didn't get a smartphone until the summer going into my sophomore year (July 2010) and it wasn't an iPhone it was the LG Ally 3G. I've been a lifelong Android user so I've always preferred Android over iOS when it comes to mobile. But I do have an iPad 10th Gen that I like to use around the house for media consumption, light gaming, and the occasional Zoom calls, but that's about it."
Lol gotcha
"Never heard of it 🤔
Thank you for sharing."
Totally understandable. That would drive me crazy
"Man that's impressive! I heard great things about OnePlus but I never owned one. However, I'm curious about them. My current phone is the Pixel 7 which I've had since launch. It's been pretty solid for me for almost 3 years now. This is my 2nd Pixel device. The first one was my beloved Pixel 2XL which I got in late 2017 and had all the way up until the release of the Pixel 7 in 2022. That phone worked flawlessly the whole time I had it. The only thing I didn't like about it was the screen, which was too dim in direct sunlight. But other than that, I didn't have a single issue with that phone. It made me a Pixel fan for the foreseeable future. The Pixel 7 is better in terms of the screen and the cameras, but the fingerprint scanner is a bit disappointing as it can be really inconsistent at times. But otherwise, the phone has performed well for me so far. I plan to keep it for another year and then upgrade to the Pixel 11 series next year hopefully."
"That's totally fair, I get that. The only things I don't like about the Pixel 7 are the fingerprint scanner and sometimes the battery life isn't the best. I'm looking to upgrade to the Pixel 11 series next year hopefully. I'm excited to finally have a TSMC made Tensor chip and an ultrasonic fingerprint scanner. 

I also want a bigger display this time around so I'm going to go with the Pro XL model next time."
Ohh ok gotcha. What's the Rokr?
That's really surprising because doesn't that phone have like 12 GB of Ram?? That's crazy
Man that sounds miserable 😖
"I've always been curious about OnePlus phones. I didn't even know they existed until the OnePlus 3 series. That was the same year I started really paying attention to the phone industry. I like what they are doing with their hardware. I'm planning to get the OnePlus buds 3 or whatever the next generation is. When Nexus phones were around I wasn't paying much attention and I really wish I did. I hear how they were some of the best phones around at the time. 

What is your current phone?"
"Totally understandable. Hopefully it will hold out until you can upgrade, my friend."
"That's totally fair. I know everyone prioritizes different things when it comes to their phones. For me I'm not a gamer or a heavy user, but for me I place a high value on software experience and good battery life (the latter is something Google needs to continue to work on of course, but when it comes to the software I haven't found anything better on the Android side of things) I'm looking to upgrade from my current Pixel 7 to possibly the 11 series next year because I'm looking forward to the TSMC made Tensor chips moving forward. I'm not expecting a huge boost in power, but I do hope there are big gains in efficiency."
How is the software experience on Honor phones? I've never used any of them since they aren't sold in my country.
"That's totally fair, thank you for sharing."
This is good to know. I'm not very familiar with MediaTek's chips because there aren't a lot of phones that are sold here in the US that include them.
"Thank you for sharing your thoughts on this. What did you switch to afterwards? Are there preferred brands you like now? I'm a lifelong Android user and I've had two early Motorola phones and 2 LG phones. The LG Ally 3G (Verizon) was my very first smartphone and it was a fun model. I only had it for a year but it was a great introduction to Android for me. Next I had the Motorola Droid Bionic from 2011-2012. I remember it having pretty good battery life for the time and it was a decent phone. But unfortunately I cracked the screen when it fell from my pocket on concrete. The Verizon store didn't have a replacement model so they gave me the Droid Razr instead and it was ok at first but about a few months in, the battery life was HORRIBLE and the processor became super slow and laggy after a year with it. The Bluetooth also stopped working and it was just a miserable experience near the end of my time with it. The LG G2 is the phone I went to next and it was a great phone when it worked. But 8 months in, the screen glitched out like crazy to the point it became unusable. Sadly that was my last LG phone... Well technically the Pixel 2XL is an LG phone since they manufactured it lol, but I don't count that 😂"
Gotcha. My wife has the 13 which she got in late 2023.
That's a decent amount of time.
Sheesssh. Thank you for sharing lol
This is why I'm not interested in foldable or flip phones at the moment. They just don't seem to be very durable and that terrifies me. Lol but I understand the appeal of them though.
Thank you so much for sharing! I'm a lifelong Android user but I only had one Samsung phone and that was the S6 which I had for 2 years. It was a good phone and remember the camera was actually really good for its time. Also that the first phone where the processor stayed pretty snappy throughout my time with it. The only issue I had with it was the abysmal battery life.
Yeah it's gross misrepresentation for sure. Makes me angry.
Man that's horrible 😕 I'm sorry that happened. Did you move on to another phone?
Man that's crazy.
Thank you for sharing! I'm a lifelong Android user but I remember at one point wanting to try Windows OS. I honestly wish they would've survived so that way we had a third major OS to compete with iOS and Android. I think competition is good.
"Good phone. I actually prefer it over the S25 Ultra, although I do like the shape of the S25 Ultra more."
"Thank you for sharing. I've never owned an iPhone. The only two Apple products I've ever owned were the OG iPhone touch (ironically my very first touchscreen device) and my current 10th Gen iPad which I like to use around the house. I don't mind iOS when it comes to the iPad but when it comes to phones, I'm team Android all the way."
Man that's crazy. I never had a OnePlus phone before but I've always been curious about them. What did you go to afterwards?
Thank you for sharing your experience on this. That's very fascinating.
Very few reviewers even mention it.
"I am used to iPhone, xperia 5 series etc so for me Ultra phones are huge. Basically, my rule, however stupid it is, I want to be able to sit down with the phone in my pocket."
"Did you know you can still order replacement batteries for this and swapping   them out for a fresh charged one made ot tolerable. I still use my v20 as my backup phone. I even bought a battery that came with its own back cover because it had the huge capacity of 10,000mAh. Can't get them  easily any more."
"Yeah I completely understand that. It's really unfortunate how people automatically assume iPhones are better because the majority of people here in the US have them, when that's not even true. I don't mind iOS when it comes to the iPad but for mobile I'm definitely all about Android. The only way I'd ever get an iPhone is if I was given one as a secondary device."
Yeah I think I'm going to follow your lead and I'm going to wait for the 11 and let them iron out any issues with switching to TSMC and also there's not really much of an upgrade if you do do it each year you definitely have to give a couple years to get any kind of difference.
We can still get the hint off that time from YouTube videos but offcourse using them was fun. don't worry u already have nice tech these days it's just we are so accustomed to all these features now to the point that we don't enjoy them because every phone has almost same stuff going on as mobile phone technology has reach to the point where its just a phone camera and social media stuff.. everything feels bland and boring these days as there is no new features to explore left. AI etc are just novel features. I remember back then phones used to deploy special buttons for quick FB or social media access directly on the phone eg HTC Chacha..as social media were starting to take off.
"I need to qualify my statements to say that Xiaomi does market segmentation so the same model may have different hardware and different network support depending on the region. So Chinese/Indian models are cheap but have poor network support for EU/NA. The 'global' models typically have much better network bands and nowadays seem to cover almost all the network bands needed for t-mobile.

Problem is US networks still need their own carrier specific updates for volte/vowifi support which the 'global'(and China/India) Xiaomi phones still have problems with."
"I remember Tech Odyssey which is a YouTuber I follow,  made several videos regarding the heating issues of the 15 Pro. I know that was the first generation where Apple started using Titanium instead of aluminum or stainless steel rails. Not sure if that has anything to do with it. 

Has it been that way the whole time for you?"
Well yea kinda but it puts a lot od hype over some things that are or old or usles to users that live normal life
I think the recent phones are much better. The phone I used had an Intel chip too. It wasn't very optimized for anything lol. Now I use a samsung a56
"Nice. Me too. Switched from the iphone right to an s7 and it was cheaper too but really good. And then to my favorite phone of all time the s10. 

But why ipad? I got the tab s7+. It's pretty old now but it's really good for media consumption and also it comes with a free spen so can mess around in notes and art as well and has quickshare so yea."
"Meaning, all of them."
"The first phone that let you put music on it.  It was limited to 128mb, pretty poor considering I had a mp3 disc player since 2001"
"ya i was surprised too its all software, the hardware is fully capable"
"Once I got a call and screen hot hanged. Didn't know who was calling, I had earphones connected so I picked it up with my earphone button. I was talking to my gf before that so I assumed it's her and said ""Hi Baby!"" But it turned out to be my mom 😭😭.

After that I got redmi note 3"
"Hate to say it but current phone is an iPhone 15 pro max. I miss Android, but the apps on my apple watch ultra are legit vs when I left Android a few years ago. 

I've got schlage deadbolts on the front and back door that I can tap the watch on and it will unlock. With or without the phone being on me.

It does a great job of tracking runs and bike rides too."
"I really like it, I much prefer it over the pixels software"
Yeah honestly the old school flip phones were the best and I miss those. But yeah I don't think they're worth it
Yeah. I went back to IPhone.
"Me too.  Microsoft got to the phone game too late.  Then only marketing their phones to business users, was a bad decision."
"Oh, that's another one:  recently i was looking for a tablet to read books in a new language i'm learning. I have an e-reader, but it gets really annoying, really fast when you have to often check words in the dictionary due to how unresponsive e-paper is. I was looking at iPad  (they were within the budget), but then i learned software i would need was paid on iOS. As opposed to free on android and windows.  
I went a bit outside of my budget and settled for 14"" 2-in-1 windows laptop... It's a bit too big, but functional.

Ps. Just to clarify, i mean the software is actually free (and open source lol), not that i can pirate it.,"
Cheap Samsung. At $150 it was still better. I've been loyal to the Pixel since though 
Definitely learned something new. I appreciate you sharing your insight on this.
The cheapest way to fix my 13 pro max is to replace the motherboard which is $200 on AliExpress. But then I see carriers like Total wireless give you a free 13 if you get a 3 month plan for $150 or other carriers have the S24 for $199 and S25 for $399 for new customers and I would only have to wait a maximum of 6 months for them to unlock. It doesn't make sense spending money on fixing an old phone when you can get a brand new one with insurance if you choose.
I honestly wish we could return to more physical buttons on the side on the sides of phones for more functionality. I like the tactile feeling of buttons. The Squeeze to assist feature and the physical back fingerprint scanner that were on my beloved Pixel 2XL were awesome.
"yeah the side frame is made from titanium

mine's been overheating easily from the first day I got it, and my model was made a few months later than models from launch so I would think the issue would be resolved then but apparently not"
"No, I completely agree with you 💯 it is a bit annoying when iPhone users act like some features are completely new when all along I had it on my Pixels and Galaxy phones for years lol 😂"
Ohh ok yeah that makes sense. I heard the Intel chips weren't good for mobile. Especially their modems. 😬
How would you compare Samsung and Xiaomi phones lineup to lineup?
"Yeah the S8-S10 generations of Galaxy S phones were peak Samsung to me. I've only had one Samsung Galaxy and that was the S6 then I switched to my beloved Pixel 2XL back on Black Friday 2017 and had it all the way up to October 2022. That phone made me a Pixel fan for the foreseeable future. I now have the Pixel 7 which I got at launch and it's been solid for me for almost 3 years now. I plan to get the Pixel watch 4 this fall and upgrade to the Pixel 11 Pro XL next year hopefully. 

The only reason I got the iPad was because my wife and I got a good deal on them at Best Buy when she needed to get her MacBook fixed. I don't use it for productivity but I actually enjoy having it around the house. However, that's really the only iOS device I don't mind having lol. Otherwise, it's Android all the way for me"
Lol gotcha 😅
Oh wow. That's super interesting! Thank you for sharing
"Hahaha 🤣 yeah that would be the final straw for me too! 😂😂😂 Lol dang man that's crazy. 

Unfortunately being in the US, I never had any experience with any Xiaomi phones since they aren't sold here."
That's totally fair and understandable. It's all about using what works best for us. No shame in that.
"Thank you for sharing 🙂 
I'm really curious about MagicOS now."
Totally fair. Thank you for sharing 🙂
Yeah it's very unfortunate 😔
That's completely understandable. Thank you for sharing! I always think these types of conversations are fun to have.
"I'm so happy to see so many Pixel users on here. Where I live I barely see them around. Although since the Pixel 6 series I have seen more of them around than I used to. 

I've been a Pixel guy ever since owning my beloved Pixel 2XL which I upgraded from my old Galaxy S6 to. I had that phone for 5 years and it was the best phone I ever owned. It remained flawless performance wise the entire time I had it.  I upgraded to my current Pixel 7 at launch and it's been solid for me for almost 3 years now. I look forward to upgrading next year to the Pixel 11 series hopefully."
I completely agree. I think that's the better route.
Man I'm so sorry to hear that 😕
I like samsung just because of less bloated and 6 year of OS updates
"I'm in the US and all my phones come straight out of china because I want true flagships , 

I can't allow myself to charge my phone overnight , or sit charging it for an hour or more , got used to charging at 80-240W and the rest seems so early 2000s makes no sense. 

Same as cameras , all mainstream brands are ripping us off , they recycle camera hardware from year after year like it is ok. 

I pay the price for a flagship to be a flagship , 

Not to use the same tech as last year or the year before that ,"
"If you do get an honor phone, don't get one of the budget devices because it may not give you as good of an experience, I'd recommend the magic 6 pro, magic 7 pro or honor 400 pro"
That makes sense. I've only had one Samsung Galaxy device and that was the S6 but that was before the One UI days. I switched to my beloved Pixel 2XL which I had for 5 years until upgrading to my current Pixel 7 which I've had since launch. I've been team Pixel ever since. But I always stay curious of other phones because I'm a phone nerd lol.
"Good point. Thank you again for sharing your experience, my friend 👊🏿"
