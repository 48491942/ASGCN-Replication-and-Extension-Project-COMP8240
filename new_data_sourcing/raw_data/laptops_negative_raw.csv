Getting a 3060 laptop that has 6gb of vram
My ROG Zephyrus has had endless issues with the keyboard and GPU switching but I have just dealt with it because of ASUS's notoriously terrible US warranty service - I half expect them to break it worse and then charge me to get sent back my still-broken laptop
Lenovo. Got a system continually got a bsod for memory management. MB replaced 4 times with their ultimate warranty. HD and ram were replaced twice. 14 trouble shooting calls in the first 6 months. Sub finally recommended I stand my ground about a full replacement. Lenovo lost the first and second replacement. After 8 months nightmare they gave me my money back. Never again.
"I bought an ASUS TUF F15 in August 2021, my first ever gaming laptop (specs in flair)

It was working fine, then in early 2022, the WiFi chip (a MediaTek one) started giving out, resulting in my online classes and tuitions getting disrupted. Although I fixed it with an external adapter, the Bluetooth is in the same chip, so it goes off randomly too.

Then in 2024, with no physical damage whatsoever, the speaker membrane got damaged and it resulted in an awful crackling sound, which I got a temporary fix. I also got it cleaned and repasted then.

Now, I doubt the GPU fan has some issues, since my games are performing really poorly and G-Helper shows GPU fan RPM at 0, and also the temporary fix for my speakers is starting to fall apart.

Honestly this has ruined my experience with TUF, and my dad was pissed he spent so much on an abomination

Will I buy a gaming laptop again? Definitely

Will it be a TUF? Hell no"
"Weren’t gaming laptops but I had a Lenovo Yoga when it first came out. I think the charge port or something broke, so I sent it in to get it fixed. Not sure what happened but they sent me 2 different ones, so I ended up with 2. A month or so passed and it died again. I had given one to my sibling, and I think theirs died too. Wouldn’t charge or anything. I still have it in storage."
Asus service sucks
"Why it might be worth it : it's small compared to a full desktop set up (for example you live in a school dorm, your don't have a big room, you need to move often for example if you're a younger person and move in-between both parents house if they're split ...). It's also a fun thing to have if you have the disposable income. 

Worst story : Asus customer support suck. I had 3 burned pixel on my ROG laptop a couple years ago and they said you need 5 minimum for warranty ... Asus customer support suck."
"Worst experience? Buying an Omen Transcend 14 without checking the TGP of the RTX 4060 in it. They gimped it at 65 max including a 25 watt boost. In real game play, it would go over about 58 watts. Extremely poor performance for a 4060 laptop. I returned to Bestbuy within 2 weeks and got a Legion Slim 5 with the 4070. Couldn't be happier with the Legion."
Mobility - I am not lugging an ATX Supertower and 2 Ultrawide monitors onto a airport when I can just lug a laptop and use in the air and airport for light games.
"I had an Asus Rog Strix GL503 (1050ti) back in the day, it was overheating like crazy and under a year it started giving me BSOD issues. Thankfully after so much back and forth, I was able to get a full refund. Their service sucked."
Got a zephruss 4090 2024 and the touch pad would stop working every couple turn on/off cycles. Got a replacement of an omen 5080 wich has a similar Gpu and better CPU preformance.
"Probably the battery life(then again my fault for selecting one with a desktop CPU .. lol ) , and the whole thing just no display out of the blue , lucky was still within warranty period ..."
"Generally expensive gaming laptops that had bad UI (screen, speakers, keyboard), cheap materials and/or bad battery life. It seems super weird that manufacturers can get away with selling something that's a bad laptop just because they managed to cram a good CPU and GPU in there."
Got a TUF for my father.  Price was great because they put some cheap ass hard drive with tech from the 90's it was simply way to slow to even run windows.  It worked alright once I replaced that but I didn't see him for a couple years after that and he already had a different laptop by then.  I guess the rest of it just didn't last.
Dell. 
"were bought acer nitro 5 (2021) before, in the first day everything its fine except the keyboard quality is poor,but to next 2 month later is arised many trouble as overheated though i away clean the fan and another port, and then is performance/battery impairment though is just 1 year later since i bought and despite i doesn't ever use over the limit, moreover many trouble as slowly to connection with usb, sound problem,etc generally is endless trouble, and finally i already sell it since 1 year ago and come back with desktop when my work no need to move a lot anymore "
"The screen of my G14 became black screen. There is no way to revert it back after many attempts. So, it just became a halftop with a dead screen"
">why do you think gaming laptops are still worth it despite the costs and lack of upgrade abilities compared to desktops?

It only has worth to those who actually need the performance to be portable, and it's not possible to use an SFF PC or use a work laptop and have a separate desktop at home.

Gaming laptops are pretty niche in that sense that while they will never be on par with a dedicated desktop for gaming, or on par with a non-gaming laptop for battery efficiency, they're still a whole lot more portable than a desktop setup and more powerful than a non-gaming laptop for graphical use. If your use case needs both portability and power, and would like have just one machine, then it makes it worth it for you."
"My ASUS G16 4090 lasted about 18 months but now barely functions due to constant 0x133 bugchecks which have persisted through a clean Windows install, latest drivers, and BIOS update. 

And of course the warranty is expired now so that $3K laptop barely lasted 18 months. 

Thanks ASUS! /s"
"I was all very pro desktop until my last one crapped out on me and everything was already out of date on it - even the case. My previous work laptop was a gaming laptop we bought 10 years ago where the GPU recently crapped out on me. We're still using it in the company though. It's outlasted our server. There was nothing we could upgrade on the server. It would be the Ship of Theseus to do any upgrades. 

My old home gaming laptop is 6 years old and I've only had to replace a noisy fan recently. I've done SSD and memory upgrades along the way. My new gaming laptop is bliss. Technically I didn't need to buy it but I thought after 6 years I deserve an upgrade.

Also if you look carefully there's decent priced gaming laptops where you can do some easy upgrades to make them great deals, whereas even entry level towers have gotten pricey."
"F the laptop, it's like a device where you can't save him,it's feels like laptop want himself to damage even though we care them.on my laptop first thing damage is whole keyboard even though i didn't use that much always clean it and it have so many problems I just give up"
"If you think your laptop 4070 or 4060 can give you playable fps on demanding games 
Without dlss 
You are wrong 
Even 4090 on laptop struggle to keep 60 fps on ultra in black myth"
This is me right now 😹 from a 1650 with 4gb to a 3060 with *gasp* 2 more GB
What keyboard issues have you been having?
What do you recommend as a gaming laptop?
"damn im kinda experiencing the same thing rn, not a lenovo but the same bsod for memory management"
"Windows key and tab key don’t work about half the time, issue persists in BIOS and doesn’t happen when I use an external keyboard so pretty sure it’s hardware related. If you’re curious about the GPU thing, I get crazy artifacting but ONLY if I have the GPU mode set to automatically switch when I open a game. If I tell the machine to only ever use the dGPU it doesn’t happen."
