Depends on your budget and style but start shopping at Uniqlo and Banana Republic (on 40%+ sale) instead for good value basics.
"If you are taking cost in into account then Uniqlo is probably the best bang for your buck. 

Grab a pair of selvedge jeans, pima cotton T shirts, airism underwear and undershirts. Then whatever else you need. 

Until you are done losing weight I wouldn't spend too much on more expensive versions. 

After that I would look at the American heritage style brands, particularly from Japan. Iron Heart makes stuff in larger sizes but check the measurement charts carefully since they are a Japanese brand and run a little small. 

For sweatshirts you can't go wrong with Wonderlooper but it comes at a premium."
"Unbranded (denim), Bronson (basics/mil-surp), Spier & McKay (suits, OCBDs, knits). 

Those brands are a start but more importantly fit is king. Get a flat measuring tape and find your measurements, then measure clothes that fit you well, and compare them to size guides. Also, looking at reviews will assist in dialing in sizing."
"If you really care about sustainability and cheap prices, used is the way to go. Lots of variety of color and styles online. For the price of a new Uniqlo piece, you can get a used Ralph Lauren on eBay and keep something nice and high quality out of the landfill."
[Asket](https://www.asket.com/us/mens)
"American Giant, Flint and Tinder, Reigning Champ"
"Merz B Schwanen, Iron Heart, Dehen 1920, imogene + willie

I would also throw Ralph Lauren and Sunspel in there with the caveat that I feel like they're a little bit overpriced, but they're also more mainstream brands and easier to find."
Everlane and Patagonia are my go-tos for exactly this reason! Both hit your sustainability checkbox and have inclusive sizing. Uniqlo's also surprisingly durable for the price point. Their airism tees have survived like 3 years of constant wear for me without stretching out weird. Just gotta say the quality difference when you upgrade from fast fashion is totally worth it
"My go-to is Uniqlo, and Banana Republic 40% off."
The gap factory has great sales and I think the quality of gap clothing is very nice. Very simple clothing and well made.
"I might be a little biased since I used to work there, but [National Standards](https://www.ntlstandards.com/) is a Canadian brand that does lots of excellent high-quality mens basics. They have pretty good sales pretty frequently, too."
"Buck mason, Taylor stitch"
"No one's done the obligatory care instructions disclaimer yet? 

Keep in mind no matter how much you splurge on clothing even the best quality garments will go downhill quickly if not cared for properly. 

Avoid washing too frequently, or infrequently. Avoid washing on excessively long cycles or at high heat.  Generally a good idea to turn most things inside out, but it's especially important for denim.  Avoid the tumble dryer, always line dry, and out of direct sun if it's coloured."
"Sunspel, merz b schwanen, really dope"
"Uniqlo, Suitsupply, /r/rawdenim  for denim"
"House of blanks makes higher quality basics but they are pricey.

Asket also is pricey but comes with impact/sustainability info"
"Uniqlo does a nice job for undershirts and such. All my casual pants, shorts, and T shirts are Patagonia, they do really well with quality."
"Just want to add that I love ASRV, pricey for sure but the quality is great"
Would definitely check out uniqlo!
"If just white works, [this](https://luxire.com/products/ezs-aria-white-crewneck-t-shirt) is the best t-shirt I have worn in a long time.

Main reason being, it feels significant and not filmsy, while being 100% cotton. Tubular, does not have side seams, is an added plus. I also like how seamlessly the neckband is attached to the body.

Site shows XL available, I wear L though.  
  
I had written to ask if they have it in other colors and they replied that currently only white. I wanted black and navy."
"Sunspel, officine generale"
"Maybe I am basic but I like Brooks Brothers and J.Crew. Just like everywhere else, not everything is great but I like most of their stuff. I look for sales. I lift weights and have a belly so their XXL/XL stuff works for me without looking odd."
"Another option that most guys don’t consider is eBay. 

For a comparable cost (maybe a bit more) to something boxy, bulky and poorly made from The Gap or H&M, you can get yourself into high-end menswear like Todd Snyder or RL. This includes your basics.

And they’re almost exclusively sold by vintage stores with high user reviews. Plus, it’s eBay - so you can make them an offer and many times they’ll jump on it.

I’ve donated years worth of generic crap in favour of a smaller wardrobe largely made up of eBay finds. My stuff fits better and looks better, and holy hell it’s all built to last.

Something to consider."
"Bylt has solid products, Buck Mason, Uniqlo still has some diamonds... also wink wink"
Uniqlo and GU (sister company of uniqlo)
A little expensive but I quite like basics from Club Monaco and Todd Snyder. High quality clothes with a specific point of view. Ledbury is great too. 
Uniqlo has the best to offer in this segment… high quality basics but at affordable prices.
Uniqlo is great
"Definitely Uniqlo or Los Angeles apparel. If you’re feeling a bit more adventurous and would like a boxy fit, there are a lot of great small la shops for that look."
I created a Free 100 Style tips for men Guide if anyone want´s some quick tips to start dessing better!
"> Banana Republic (on 40%+ sale)

This is important to know: everything at BR goes on sale at 40% off all the time."
Would include The Gap as well. Solid basics and same parent company as Banana Republic so it's also on sale constantly.
BR quality sucks. Bro is asking about quality and talk recommending fast fashion mall brands??
[deleted]
I love wonderlooper. Great recommendation.
"Prioritizing fit, I absolutely have to recommend against Unbranded, unless you can try them on in person. Miserable return policy for the variety of offered items. If you don’t fit into any of their cuts, you’re stuck with $100+ of store credit that you literally cannot use"
I love my Asket overshirt but it’s kinda overpriced IMO.
[deleted]
Buck Mason too.
Love American Giant
"This list i 100% agree with everything said, are you my mom by any chance?"
"That's not the case anymore. A few years ago, BR really tightened up their sales. Things dont go on sale as often. The 40% Friends and Family Sale is twice a year: once in the spring and once in the fall. I always hold out to stock up on chinos and other office clothes."
"Same parent company but not made in the same places - GAP fit and materials are garbage once you get used to BR, and BR is quite mid in terms of both."
"Maybe you're referring to the old BR but in recent years BR stepped up their game. Not every piece is at the same level but most stuff I get from them is solid, better than most mall brands for sure. Just skip BR Factory, their quality is considerably worse"

Japan loves Ameircana workwear and has a long history with denim. There is an entire subculture over there dedicated to the 50s do-wop/greaser look.
They have a real passion for it that it is just super rare in actual Americans. So yeah they have completely taken up the slack on creating what USA stopped creating. Thankfully they did or we'd only have a very very few making it
"If OP is US based, Amazon carries UBs. Then, returns are not an issue."
"They have L-Tall as a sizing option, which I love."
They have tall versions of all their sizes as well!
"Half my wardrobe is BR and there's been definitely more than two 40% sales last year. In BR Canada there was a 40% off everything including sales (except leather) since Black Friday all the way until end of January.

But yeah, still definitely less sales than years ago"
"They're owned by the same company as The Gap and Old Navy. They're slightly more upscale than those but it isn't good, it doesn't even match J Crew who's been going downhill"
"Fine is the best possible description of BR.

It’s fast fashion with more expensive photo shoots."
[deleted]
"Well, that's not the case in the US at all. Like I said, I keep a close watch because I buy my work clothes there. They run extra % off sale items more often, but big discounts on full priced items are rare and have been for a few years."
