No wait… Walmart is worse"
I’m gonna say Walmart. But particularly one in like Alabama or Florida.
All unbranded/fast fashion stores

Walmart or Meijer. Even the clothes on the shelves barely match each other.
"On a slight tangent, there are shops selling ""second hand USA clothes"" in my country, and just from one trip to local market, I have seen so many second hand T-shirts that are clearly from the US. Some of them have, let's say, questionable designs. 

To be fair, though, they are still better than, say, being thrown away in the landfill or ultrafast-produced fast fashion stuffs, I suppose."
I’d have to say Forever 21.. Have you seen the sayings on the backs of the shirts?!
