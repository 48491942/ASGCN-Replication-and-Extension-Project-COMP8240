OnePlus from their beginning. I like the hobby element. Also Hi-Res audio.
"Google Pixel. I'm deep into the Google ecosystem: Drive, Photos, Calendar, Gmail, Contacts, etc. Thus, the Pixel is the best fit for my use case."
"Samsung.

I started out with Apple but didn't like how little it could be customized. I'm sticking with it because it runs the best version of software that I use every time I drive: highway radar which connects my radar detector via Bluetooth."
"Originally, BlackBerry. They were the only company that gave me a complete phone with everything I wanted. Then it's a tie between Sony and Vivo. Sony for always keeping the legacy features I love, and vivo for the insane camera tech and IR blaster."
Subjective I know but redmagic
"Motorola. Good price, love their gestures, no preloaded crap. I tried using Apple, was missing too much stuff that I was used to."
"Whoever does the job best for me at the time of buying. I’m not blindly loyal to any company. Decisions are based on what I want from a phone, prior performance and experience with their products as a whole. I’ll come in with preferences, but the final decision is influenced by those things"
All time? Sony Ericsson
"BlackBerry and Sony. I always loved BlackBerry, and I always thought Sony made the coolest Android alternatives to Samsung/LG/HTC back when those were the big ‘droid makers. 

I haven’t owned a BlackBerry in well over a decade, and never owned a Sony Android. But always wanted one. Out of phones I’ve owned recently, I’d have to say Apple."
"Google. I love the software, features, and cameras."
"Apple. Mostly because I’ve been using iPhones since 2010 so I prefer sticking to something im familiar with. I use my phone strictly for calls, texting, and browsing so I don’t need the extra features android OS has. I daily an iPhone 15 Pro and I do have a Sony Xperia as my work phone since I think having 2 of a similar phone is weird and it’s cool to have both OS’s on hand."
"Samsung XCover because they have removable batteries.

I've had several phones with dead batteries and it's e waste. An absolute disgrace!!  It's disgusting that most phones don't have easily replaceable batteries. I'm assuming it's consumers fault for wanting thinner phones. Consumer demand."
Formerly Samsung. Now Sony due to user friendliness and comfort (eg headphone jack)
Sony!
"I base preference on the phone and price. OnePlus has been great recently. I avoid Apple due to their ecosystem, price, and lack of user freedom."
"I like a few different brands for various reasons, but for my personal devices I prefer OnePlus and for business I prefer Pixel. Motorola makes a good alternative for either."
Brand loyalty is for suckers.
"Xiaomi, at least on my country. They give more techs for lesser price."
Samsung and Google make the best Android phones.
"Sony Xperia. I've just loved the brand since the Walkman series. It's the only brand right now that provides SD Card and 3.5mm headphone jack on its flagship phones at the moment. Also just like the simplicity. Also loved the form factor, which was ditched this series"
"During start of smartphone era, I prefer Apple, but then I like Samsung, until near end of last decade I start to prefer more OnePlus and XiaoMi, until present day."
"I have and do really enjoy using Google devices. BUT, I have been using Samsung lately because they are also great and they always give great deals. I have an iPhone for work, and it's okay, but I don't necessarily enjoy using it"
OnePlus since the OnePlus One was my entrance into the Smartphone World
"Motorola for good hardware and good prices, tv out

Samsung for the software, cámaras, tv out. 

I value tv out as an emulation nut"
Google. Photography and practical features.
Samsung's Note range. For obvious reasons.
"Apple to socially fit in and OnePlus for offering such good phones for a lower price. Tariffs will ruin it, though. 😭😭😭"
"I've bought 3 different Honor branded phones since 2015. The first 2 phones I bought, they were owned by Huawei in the 2010s, and my latest phone is from the independent company."
"You get a lot of bang for your buck with the pixel phones. Solid hardware and updates. 
I prefer Samsung but you’re going to pay top dollar for them vs Google."
Apple for security.
Huawei but currently using a samsung
OnePlus for sure.
Sony. Their last 2 phones are near perfect and they keep improving them every year while keeping their strengths
"Sony, if they sold it here."
"Huawei because of the innovation and how strong Huawei is.
imagine Samsung got this ban, surely they couldn't survive like Huawei survived."
"Samsung all the way.

Apple is everything that's wrong with big tech. So I've had many different Androids before but Samsung is just far better than the rest. Their hardware tends to be at the cutting edge but most importantly Samsung's software is just the best. Everything from their AI tools to their built-in spam blocker (Hiya) just rocks. One UI is the best Android layer out there and unlike the Chinese brands Samsung's close Google partnership means everything Google phones have is also on Samsung phones. With Samsung you have two major tech powerhouses covering every base you could ever want covered on your device.
Unless something big changes, I won't be looking elsewhere again."
OnePlus for speed and stability even several years after purchase.
"Samsung, I used Samsung Galaxy S6 then switched to LG, OnePlus and recently Xiaomi Poco all flagships, but almost all phones disappointed me. Some (LG, Xiaomi software) and OnePlus hardware issues. Now switched to S24 Ultra and I'll never looked to anyother brand again."
I was die hard HTC really miss them went Samsung and Google after that now have a red magic 9 pro
"Apple and Google, because those smartphones are reference"
"Samsung!! 

Becuase i buy midrangers. 

Samsung gives good Gorilla glass protection, Prompt and solid update policies. 

Eg: A56

That's it!!"
"Pixel, decent camera Graphene OS. 

Although next il be tempted by oneplus or Nothing phone, although now that pixel does a 'normal' size pro that will be hard to ignore."
"I used to love xiaomi, then huawei now it’s Apple. Huawei will forever be my biggest love though. The p9 pro was sensational"
"Despite what's happening lately, it's Samsung, mainly because my first phone was a Samsung phone, and my first Android device was also a Samsung, and I've gotten more accustomed to it"
"Google and Apple for different reasons. Apple for Health tracking and Google for os features. So, I have both."
i was all apple (loved the apple SE's models size)  until i got a pixel 9a..... Price was $200 new. top notch camera! oled screen. i cant tell the difference if its apple or google. Feels the same.
"I'm not fan of any particular brand.  Now when I look back, I think I'm someone who buys products primarily for their value for money.  

I had:  Nokia 6300, Sony Xperia X10, Sony Xperia Z Ultra, Mi Max 3, OnePlus 8 pro, Oppo Find X5, and now Vivo X100Pro.

If there's one brand I had a soft spot for, ten years ago, it would be Sony."
Sony Xperia is my sentimental favourite but the Google Pixel 6 was probably the best all-around phone I ever used.
Xiaomi doing something which others can only dream 
"I've went through a lot of phones and I've settled mostly on OnePlus.  I've had the 6t, 7t, 8t, 12, and 13.  I also tried the 11 but returned it in favor of the Pixel 7 Pro.  Speaking of which, I've really tried to love Pixels but I have problems with almost every single one.  I'd prefer Pixel for the more open nature and day one updates.  OnePlus isn't far behind on updates though.

I also gave Samsung a fair try with the S24+ and S24 Ultra.  They can't capture active shots like my kids, especially playing sports.  I don't care how great Dex is or how many accessories are available if a $1200ish phone can't take a clear picture.  

I'm in the US sooo that's just about my only options.  I won't do iPhones due to lack of user control like no user accessible file system.  Motorola would be great (I really like the Thinkphone look) but they're behind on their cameras and software updates."
"Was a Samsung premium phone user for the decade, got frustrated with the prices, tried one plus 12, am a total convert to one plus"
"You can't escape Google. Whoever or whatever you use. To make life easier, I choose Pixel."
"Asus: people just ignore their rog phone because they think it is a gaming phone. But if you see otherwise it has best processor best camera best display, best haptics and so on and battery as well. It is the only android phone that I can say is a complete package and can compete neck to neck with apple."
"I always have been an iphone guy, recently I really started liking androids, and also recently I broke my 12 pro max and had to use a 6s, holy shit I liked that 6s lol, it so convenient in size and buttons and everything I love that. 

As a brand its hard to say, because I really dont agree with many software and pricing stuff that apple does. My android fav is samsung but samsung also makes some shit that bothers me to hell, like the constant copying, for example the watch ultra which isnt only a bad temu copy of the apple watch ultra but it also has horrendous software, its just oof, also why the f is the charging speed not up to the competitors yet?. Xiaomi and its subbrands make some cool shit but they also looove to copy which just looks very very bad sometimes and unoriginal. Google is okay in my eyes, I dont have favorites or beefs to pick with them. I had a huawei once and kinda liked that, the camera was peak, but recently they really aint doin it for me without google. Honor and nothing are in a cathegory for me where they do some stuff that I like, for example honor's camera can surprise me and i like nothing's originalness in its os, but also some stuff that I dont like for example honor's software aint my fav and so is not nothing's outer phone design and cameras.

So after reading all this lol I wont pick a fav for now, you guys comment and if a new phone comes out from somewhere thats from a good brand hit me up"
"OnePlus, for experience, affordable and never failed me"
"My preferred brand is Google. Every couple years, I'll venture out and try something else like Samsung, OnePlus, iPhone, and honestly they're all perfectly fine and each has something that they do better than the other...but, within a couple months, I always end up going back to a Pixel phone.

  
I like their UI, no bloat, and Pixel-exclusive features like Call Screening. Also, while there are other phones out there that might have better cameras in different lighting, the Pixel's camera always takes acceptable pictures."
Been using OnePlus exclusively since the 3t.  Hard to beat from a bang for your buck perspective.
Google pixel
"Google pixel, it just works!"
Xperia Series From SONY
OnePlus. The deals are too good so I upgrade every year. Got the OnePlus 13 (16gb ram 512gb rom) and the OnePlus watch 2 for $387 (USD) after a trade in and early preorder.
"google.
i bought pixel because i thought ""well, i'm used to google's services, why not try their hardware"" I was switching from samsung and what i really liked about the pixel is it's software. it is buttery smooth, looks clean and fresh. also cameras are amazing, both photo and video, but every flagship today is in the same level kinda, so the cameras are not the selling point anymore (but i like the fact that all 3 modules are 50 mp, neither samsung nor apple give you that)
i'm positive that you can buy something better for that money in terms of camera and software from chinese brands, but i don't think it will be as good as the pixel outside of china"
"Samsung, ultra easy to use, customizable, classy, ​​inexpensive, the photo quality is there depending on the range. Works for a long time, they only get better with time, and the design of the phone becomes more and more attractive 😊"
"After using phones from all major brands, I prefer Samsung for now. Minimal design, not bad software, good hardware, and too many features."
"Nexus/Pixel. 

Been using Nexus/Pixel phones since I got away from the old Sidekick phones in the early 2000s. Tried Samsung, hated it, and immediately came back to Google. I don't need bloatware, and pure Android is the best OS IMO"
"I can go with any brand as long as it’s not mainland Chinese. Currently my daily driver is an iPhone 16 and my backup phone is a Galaxy A33. I have used LG, Sony, HMD’s phones in the past too."
"Sony. Just wish they had better software, but when it works, it works beautifully.

Also headphone jack."
"Motorola, the last 4 smartphones I used were of motorola. Currently using Moto edge 30 . Best purchase!!"
"Samsung.
1. Android
2. Great customization
3. Love their character/theme in general"
"I can't pick a favourite. I currently have a Xiaomi 14 because of its size and camera quality. The OS is shit though. On the other hand I owned an Asus ZenFone 9 and I loved it, superb clean and fast software , side mounted fingerprint scanner dead fast with scrolling function,  the cameras were bad. No phone company makes a compact phone with outstanding hardware and software for me, so I prioritise the hardwares hence I always end up picking Xiaomi that has great value for what it packs."
"Honor. Their foldable hardware is honestly a step above everbody else (although Oppo seems to have caught up this generation). I'm using a global Honor Magic V2 in the US and it is just the best. Even their software is pretty great these days. I got Android 15 back in January: the first non-pixel foldable to get it. I dumped a bunch of sand into my hinge by mistake and after washing it out (even though the phone is not IP rated) and opening/closing a bunch, back to normal. That was back in June of last year and phone has been flawless since. No case and device looks like new still. Hopefully the tarrifs don't ruin my chances of picking up an Honor Magic V5 later this year!"
"Samsung. They're usually reliable, I like the UI, the customization and smooth connectivity it has with my other Samsung devices. "
"I  like Nokia. It was my  first phone back in 1996—one of those classic models with the small screen and real buttons. It was simple, strong, and just worked. No touchscreens or fancy stuff, but it lasted forever and never gave me problems. Even now, I’ve been using Nokia phones again for the past 5 years.  It’s been super reliable. No crashes, no weird bugs, and the battery easily lasts a full day. I don’t need a fancy camera or tons of features—I just want a phone that’s stable and does what I need, and Nokia does that really well. I did use an iPhone in the past, but I had issues. It looked nice, but it felt like I had to take care of it all the time. With Nokia, I don’t have to worry—it just works, and that’s what I value most."
I’ve been using iPhones since 2008 and will stick with them.
"Google. I've been using their phones for the last 12 years or so. Nexus 4, Pixel 2XL, 6 Pro (got stolen recently) and now the 9 Pro.
Among these, the 6 Pro was my favorite. A powerhouse"
"I loved Huawei before they banned native GMS, my p30 pro was the GOAT, such an amazing phone for it's time, still takes photos better than my wife's iPhone 16"
"Apple, Samsung, Oppo, OnePlus, Google"
Pixel. Camera 🤌🏽 UI 🤌🏽🤌🏽🤌🏽 Bugs 🪲🪲🪲
"Anything but Apple.




Been using mainly Sony for some decade."
Google because of relatively clean interface. Switched to Pixel 8 for this reason after my Nokia 8.1 died.
Google. Has everything plus the integration is seamless. I also if I have to choose would rather not use Apple vs Google in the battle of oligarch monopolies
"Google Pixel for me. I’ve dabbled with more or less every brand of other phones before settling on iphone for the last 8 or 9 years. I then went pixel 7 pro>pixel 8 pro>iphone 16 pro max - because I thought i missed the apple eco system, but having a mix of android and OSX really wasn’t that big a deal. After owning the 16 pro max for 6 months I’ve realised that it’s not as good even as the pixel 8 pro. My Pixel 9 Pro XL arrives tomorrow and I couldn’t be happier."
"Sony. Forever and always. There are a LOT of reasons, honestly, but the chief among them is that they are the Keepers of the Sacred Flame of 3.5mm."
"I've had a great 4yr run with my Nokia XR20, but I'm thinking of moving to a Google Pixel, for its 7 years of updates and other unique security features - come this year's the next Black Friday sales."
These days its the Google Pixel. The first couple smart phones were Blackberries though and then I went to the Samsung Galaxy for a couple generations. They were all amazing!
"Nokia, the last phone I used from them was Nokia 6.1 (2018) worked great for 5 years, the software was clean there were no ads or unwanted applications installed, everything was good just the battery was 3000mAh which was not enough and it was also ending on it's life cycle so had to switch to a Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, this phone is good too but too much pre-installed apps, ads popups, unstable updates etc.

Nokia will be my pick again if they create more phones in Android category."
Google Pixel (I have an 8 Pro)
OnePlus
"Google Pixels and Samsungs. Reason being is that I'm deep into the Google ecosystem and use everything in it that I can, aside from a few things (I don't limit myself exclusively to that ecosystem), so naturally the Pixel works best for me. I also love the software and how clean it is, and the cameras. 

Samsungs because imo they're second best to Google and since they have a close partnership with them I decided that if a Pixel phone wasn't good enough for me then a Samsung surely would be."
Vivo/OPPO for having the best camera systems out there.
"Used to be Motorola until Lenovo decided to give 0 fucks about customers.

Now it's Google for the same reason Motorola was my choice: No bloatware and therefore good performance."
"I like redmagic phones because there good at gaming and have advanced features and I like OnePlus phones for there simplicity, power, and waterproofness and I like Google pixel phones for their many updates for example my Google my 4 year old google pixel 6  is still getting updates and the new google pixel 9 will get 7 years of updates! And I like Samsung phones for their features simplicity and customizability"
"Sony.

Always had a soft spot for them. And now that there isn't a brant (other than ZTE) that doesn't put a hole in my screen for the selfie camera, Sony has become my preferred by default. It doesn't hurt that Sony also has one of the best camera systems and displays on the market, not to mention top tier audio quality from their 3.5mm jack for all of my wired headphones lying around. Sony deserves my vote because everyone else has abandoned me."
My preferred phone brand is Xiaomi for the insane value for the price and Sony for their unique cameras that don't use too much processing and gives a lot of control to the user.
iPhone. It just works like it should with no laggy performance or random errors.
"Samsung because of the Smart Tags (they are bad imo) and the long software support. Also there are some nice features but for that premium pricepoint i was expecting more (now have the s23+, otherwise i always had 200€ chinese phones which died after the warranty expires)"
Vivo X200 Pro mini
"I'd love another Huawei over anything else, but I can't be bothered with all the Micro G/GBox stuff to get some apps to work."
"I don't really stick with a brand - I just pick whatever phone seems to be the best deal/option for me at that point in time. When I craved a smaller flagship I went with a base S20, now I wanted bigger and got a OnePlus 13.

The only hill I'm willing to die on is not switching back to Apple. Used to have iPhones as work phones, but I just never could get used to the OS/ecosystem. I've used Android a lot more (and longer), so I know it inside out - no reason for me to switch OS."
Samsung and Apple. Just thought about trying Nothing but that will have to wait.
"One plus, as the stereo speakers are bloody brilliant, I'm on my one plus 8 pro now, which also has 12gb ram, wireless charging and it's a little bit slimmer or wide as other phones and it also has high res audio, and I'm a musician so thsts important to me, they are literally the best speakers /audio through the headphones I've ever heard, listening to dnb as I write this and it's very good, very good bass, , the cameras are good but i never really care about cameras as I'm not taking selfies all day 🤣and thinking other people might want to see, it's got a camera and thsts good enough for me"
"The phone manufacturer that will sell me what I want. Expandable atorage via Micro SD, wireless charging, decent processing, water resistance, and a price that isn't absurdly high due to greed. I don't give an F what company that is."
"I've dailied phones from Apple, Samsung, Motorola, HTC, Google, Palm/HP, LG, and BlackBerry. Google is my go-to brand. I've had the Pixel 3, 3XL, 4a 5G, 7, 8, and 9 Pro. Default Android is the way to go imo, and their cameras and AI features are unmatched."
"Phone I love oneplus, camera Samsung, video Sony.. 


If op would get a solid camera and money was no object (carrier deals make Samsung, Google, or iPhone the phones of choice) I would pick op over everyone.."
Nothing ATM
OnePlus!
"Samsung and Google, we’re limited in the States. 

My first Android was the HTC Evo, and one of my all time favorites was the Moto Turbo with the Kevlar back, that was before Motorola was bought by Lenovo."
"I used to be a die hard Samsung fan in the earlier years when they allowed bootloader unlocks, etc but then Knox came and made things tons harder….Same thing for the Pixels, you have to pay your phone off in order for you to get the “OEM unlock” option to show up…so I completely gave up. Customizing Android isn’t fun like it used to be, but it’s still somewhat appealing…

I’ve gotten older (I’m 30 lol) and I want things to just work now…so I transitioned (again) over to the Apple ecosystem. The phones are supported for a decent time…it’s pretty, the cameras are amazing (but the 14 and 15 kinda went a tad downhill) organized and not fragmented like Android. **BUT EVERYTHING OVER HERE IS SUBSCRIPTION BASED!** and it’s quite annoying and sad. Customization is getting better for sure, especially being able to set default apps, but iOS still feels slightly locked down. And maybe that’s okay, because…security (I like to believe this lie too. I try not to store sensitive info in iCloud and I have Photos sync OFF).

Edited for iOS support times."
Google. The only ones that have decent enough security for GrapheneOS.
Bought a Pixel 8 last years. Steroids.
"Samsung or Apple, Apple made the most recent compact phone, and I like the additional features Samsung phones bring to Android."
"Apple and Pixel, they have small phones"
"Not loyal to any of them. I have a Pixel 9 Pro, iPhone 16 and S25 Ultra. Love them all for different reasons."
Samsung
Mine are Samsung and Asus. I have great experiences with some of their products and the aftersales service is easy to find.
"Samsung personally, mainly because I been with them for years and I'm so use to oneui and picking up a pixel before actually felt lackluster compared to what Samsung has built in along with good lock. Though while samsung features I do miss i am trying out iphone for a bit but might end up switching back to samsung idk yet"
"Samsung and Motorola 
Samsung for all the features that they stick in their phones. People would think Google would modify the software better because they own it but they don't. Motorola because I get the most bang for the buck buying a  2 year old version of their phones. When I was using iOS I used to fall back on Motorola to do all my Android task cheaply."
"Switched from a Pixel 7 Pro recently to Xiaomi 15 Ultra, the camera module was leaps and bounds ahead.

I do not think I have any brand loyalty per se.

When Elite 3 gets released downstream will see which one has better camera module - could be vivo, might be xiaomi again, or something else."
"oneplus 13, can unlock bootloader, can root, the vibration experience is currently the best, the battery life is also good, and the camera is at the forefront level"
"Motorola, inexpensive and close to vanilla Android"
"Apple, I love the simplicity of it and how well it pairs with their other tech."
"Apple. Although with the Apple Intelligence scandal it’s beginning to sway me but I’m still here. 

Apple has the most security features of all and it’s also convenient to use iPhones, since it’s one of the most common phones out there, everything is optimised well for iOS."
"Apple cos of better optimization of apps and games...plus videos are better on ios

And samsung just the ultra series cos of its boxy design and have always like one ui and the freedom of customization it brings..especially after one ui7 and good lick cant even imagine going back to other device
N outdoor photos are great on samsung

Have been buying each S series and iphone from the start... Change both device each year

Currently on s25 ultra as primary and ip 16 pm as secondary"
Samsung
"Xiomi due to custom rom support, sadly that has changed  and I am onto no fixed brand now"
"1. Apple- they just good. I love the camera quality in social media, I love they're security systems, they're pretty stabile in price, so then you can sell it for good amount, and I think that apple prefers quality over quantity.
2. Samsung S series- classic, pretty good, but worse than Apple In quality. For example- I have samsung S21 for 2 years, it's getting hot, and one day the back fall of, I had to glued them back."
"all phone brands with colors/realmeos/oxygenos-the reason they give the best specs for the money and never disappoint.
motorla and tcl the best stock android experience and also really good specs for the money
honor-camera"
"I started my smartphone journey with the Nokia Lumia 720 and then the 950 XL. As Windows Phones saw their downfall, I moved to Google. I started with 2XL and 3XL and am now holding 7 Pro. The main reason for shifting to a Pixel is the clean Android experience.

  
That said, this may be my last Google Pixel phone, as I see that the Pixel Drops are becoming less interesting for older devices."
1 year into using a one plus daily.... The hype is real
"I like particular models each year and that's it. Brand loyalty is dumb, i dislike them all equally."
"Using realme.
Dont like it much.
Wana switch but can not decide.
Google or samsung"
"Apple. Fluidity, Apple wallet/card, Native apps and services"
"Apple. Been using it since 2014 as my daily driver. Not a gamer and don’t have any social media apps installed aside from Reddit, so I primarily use it mostly for work related stuff and entertainment like Spotify and Netflix. I don’t have the time anymore to tinker with phones like I used to way back when I was still using Android phones, and I like the support it gets in terms of security and updates even when the product is already EOL. 

But I don’t upgrade quite often. I’m still using an iP13 since it’s released and the performance is still top notch with 88% battery health left."
"Samsung.

While its far from perfect, I really like the fact that they are one of the few manufacturers making a truly compact flagship. Software side of it works great for me, since I like to have a good amount of customization so Oneui is perfect for me in that regard.
The first-party ecosystem is not bad either! I'm currently using a S24, Watch7, Buds3 Pro, Tab S9 and am planning to get a laptop from them soon, as well. As a bonus, the accessory selection is only second to iPhone 🙂

I also tried a Pixel fairly recently - while the overall experience was really good, it was just a bit too basic for my liking. Loved the cameras though!"
"Samsung, purely for one UI and things like stackable widgets which you can't get on any other android brand"
"Huawei, my Huawei Mate 20 Pro is durable af

it's such a shame there's no gms on newer type, so for next phone i just bought Vivo X200 instead (i heard good thing about Vivo, hope it could last forever)

my Huawei Mate still works till now, i use it as 2nd phone"
"Samsung for sure ! 
Because of well established after sales service and software experience, specially after one UI 7"
Nokia
Sony...most unique phones with stock android.
"Rn Motorola, Edge series. Fantastic curved displays and very good UI with extra Moto apps like Smart Connect and Unplugged. Sleek and elegant designs and Turbo fast charging! 

The only issue for many is the late software delivery which I personally don't mind at all cuz we receive them in any case.

Great job Motorola team!"
I was a Samsung stan for the longest time now I won't buy anything but a Google Pixel.
Used to be an apple fanboy but now Samsung all day
"Apple. I use extensively for slack, emails, browsing, texting.
I really appreciate that my macbook, iPad and iPhone are always synced and I can continue wherever I want. 
Facetime with my parents. 
I am not into too much customization, so it’s been great. 
Siri is pretty useless but very good at adding to my todo list and keeping timers."
xiaomi something something im broke
"No preference, whichever puts the best camera on a phone at the time of purchasing....so that will never include iPhone, Pixel or Galaxy phones.  Currently Xiaomi 14 ultra but had Honor, Huawei, Sony, HTC going back through the years"
"Vivo, then Oppo, then Samsung, then Honor. I currently have an Honor phone. Samsung lacks memory (128 to 256 GB in midrange?!) and Honor lacks OS polish and reliability. Vivo is usually good all around, while Oppo should have more care for their selfie optics, usually weaker than the competition."
Huawei
"OnePlus/Oppo......
Their OS itself is enough for me to never go back to Samsung/xiaomi or Apple"
Samsung
"Apple, I’ve always used their phones so i’m just used to it, but most phones are good these days"
[removed]
"Huawei originally, their software was just so stable, my Mate 9 never crashed or froze up. I still miss that in every phone I've had since.

Oppo X2 Pro, customisation with ColorOS was great. Everything just worked. Easy to use and set up, really loved the vegan leather back. The camera was a bit 💩 but screen quality was good.

Google for their cameras, had my Pixel 8 Pro four months, but just couldn't get on with it. Calls kept dropping, couldn't often connect to the WiFi or 4G and the amount of times the phone crashed, I had to reboot the phone four times in about two hours. 

I've shortlisted two phones I'm next hoping to try: Honor Magic 7 Pro or Oppo Find X8 Pro."
"Sony. Weird kinks, undercooked software, and shitty company aside, the fact of the matter remains that they still provide one of if not the best hardware packages of any flagship phone in the market. 

I've been fortunate so far that the sum total of my issues with Sony don't actively ruin the phone or make my life worse too, so until they make phones, or until someone with a better grasp of software releases a phone with the same hardware features, I'm gonna stick with them."
"I don't select tech by brand, but the most price/performance hardware they offer for the money I have at the time. I have used Huawei, Oneplus (currently using 8T), Samsung, Sony, Xiaomi in the past.


I find brand loyal communities to be superficial and toxic in regards to people who hop between brands when they shouldn't care what someone does with their money."
"I have an honor. Wife has an apple and had a Samsung before. All flagships. She wishes she picked an honor instead. I had a Huawei before and it was leagues ahead of its time. Honor is sort of like a sister brand to Huawei that has google services so I went with that. The battery (charging) and camera is ahead of the competition, but not as much as Huawei is."
Anyone remember Siemens? They were affordable and very cool.
"Motorola fan here. Best value for money in midrange phones. My Edge 30 Neo was extremely snappy and fast with its Snapdragon 695.

Been a Pixel user since last Friday, but already considering switch to Samsung (otherwise my least favorite brand, havent had a Samsung since 2013) after looking at S25.

I wanted to try OnePlus, but their phones are heavy as brick. Xiaomi i dont bother, the OS looks like some childrens play game interface."
I really enjoyed my Motorola Droids. Had a Pixel 3a and loved it. Moved to iPhone and happy with what I have. No preferences as I’ve enjoyed both.
"OnePlus as of right now. I have the OnePlus 13 and I like what they're doing especially at that price - beating Samsung(S25U) in almost everything while still being around 300$ cheaper(and even cheaper if you buy it from a site that's based in China(tradingshenzen in my case)like I did).

I would definitely put Oppo and Vivo up there, since they might be(probably are) better than OnePlus, but are less accessible and available internationally."
"Samsung for a cell phone because when I first got a cell phone it was an android, so every time I get a new phone I do stay with Samsung phones because I like the system.

Also, I do have Apple devices, because there are apps that are really cool that are available with Apple."
Sony. Supremacy.
"Mine is Samsung! I love the ecosystem they're creating. I know they are a bit behind Apple on this, but I think they keep working on it and the development is noticeable. Also, they offer a wide range of devices unlike other brands, and they seem to be the ones who have the most developed ecosystem on Android. In my opinion, they offer a great balance between different features, a great range of devices to have and user experience (as in you don't need to know a lot about programming/informatics to have nice things)."
"My favourite phone ever is the Oppo Find X2. I still have it,but it has screen burn. I replaced it with an IPhone 16 Pro Max, wish I hadn't."
"Apple. 

I’m just used to it now and using any Android feels weird. Plus, I own a MacBook, an Apple Watch, an iPad, and I love how seamlessly they work together. Most of my friends and family have iPhones as well, and while we use WhatsApp and Instagram here, using AirDrop is so convenient.

I don’t need to customize everything. I really prefer an OS where I feel I don’t need to change much and that’s what iOS is to me. I still can use the Google and Microsoft apps I need, the camera is good in any situation (including low light, moving objects and videos), and the in-app camera in social media apps preserves the image quality I want. The number of third party accessories is so much bigger. I have found great third party apps that suit my needs, some of them are iOS exclusives or simply work better on iOS. After sales service is better, at least in my country, and specially out of warranty service, while paid, it’s easy to find authorized providers compared to other brands. The phone will hold its value for longer when I ever decide to upgrade, and I can use it for years knowing I get the latest software updates in the same day as everyone else, regardless of the model. So many of the default apps work amazing and are nice to use."

Samsung. The Snapdragon versions.
"Samsung, with Google in very close second"
[removed]
Used to be samsung then Xiaomi now vivo
"xiaomi, too many useful functions"
"Samsung. Complete ecosystem in the country I live in. Runs Android, OneUI"
"Samsung


It used to be Google. But pixel 4 really turned me off. Messenger would have issues. My first samsung was an s22u and I love the camera. I had pixel 2 cl to 4xl and when I got to 4 it was really bad."
"For me it is Xiaomi, reasonable price with a good specs. I've started with flagship killer like Mi 10T pro, and now using an actual flagship like Xiaomi 15. Some may say Xiaomi UI is suck, it is but doable for me."
I was Sony. Then I was Samsung. Then I became oneplus now I’m iPhone
"1. Samsung - most refined software and features/customization via goodlock. Software is so good I'm willing to overlook trash battery because of it 😂

2. OnePlus - best hardware at least in US (great battery and fast charging (67-80w), 2 things my Samsung phones lack despite their great software). OnePlus also has my 2nd fav software. Cameras good could be better.

3. Apple - gold apple watch and apple credit card 🤷🏾‍♂️🤣 if it wasn't for the 2 things I wouldn't use iPhone but they get the job done.

4. Motorola - always made great phones just lackluster support. Decent amount of features and offers fast charging 45-68w.

5. Google - I like pixels but haven't had one since the pixel 7 because of lack of features. At this point stock android has even less customization than iOS. Great call screening and voice dictation. Don't really use photo editing but heard it's great too.

6. Xiaomi - honorable mention, hadn't used one in about 5 years because it only works with one carrier for me (mint mobile), but their redmi/Poco phones were my go to before I could afford flagships."
"Apple, because the battery lasts much longer than all my previous android phones. Plus its a lot less bloatware than all the chinese ones."
Before huawei got fucked i would've never thought of switching to samsung
currently samsung just because I currently own one in mid range tier and probably this is my most amazing possession that actually helps me in my day to day life.
"Samsung but cant afford it anymore. Thats why Im using redmi note since 2020,and it sucks."
I don't keep a prefered brand because brand loyalty is not good. I only get phone which gives the most value for money for the price after research
"Huawei best for the look and also its capability and photography. removing GMS from them is for a reason. Do think about it. 

But apple to brag and show off. 

i actually have an iphone 15 pro max(gifted at work) and also a huawei P40 pro(using since 2020)"
"Xiaomi and its not even really close.  They (along with Oppo) are really the only ones that actually innovate year in and year out instead of releasing the same product year after year with minor differences.  But I have also never used a bad Xiaomi product even beyond their phones.  Tablets, earbuds, appliances they are all good products.

But I do use a Google Pixel for work and there is a lot I like about it.  I usually recommend the Pixel A series to most people.   I just wish Google's more expensive phones had much better QC and weren't so far behind in some areas like their horrid modems and charging situation that seems stuck in 2019."
would choose oneplus if they had an spen like samsung does
Apple and Samsung
[removed]
"From the premium phones i have used g pro2, p30 pro, s22u and now 16pm, the worst is s22u by far and favorite one is p30"
"I use iphone now, but always loved sony, but sony is shit in software update even now. Back in the old days, when OG pixel came out, whoever own a pixel will get first hand on android update. While others have to wait in line for the their respective brand developer to build that update for them. I don’t think that’s the case anymore. But Sony still is shitty in that department. While most brand are focusing on 5 - 7 years software update. Sony is still stuck in the slow ass update and old mindset.

But the android skin is love to me. Its less bloat, and doesnt feel to much skin like Xiaomi. It felt like Nothing OS in a way."
iPhone cos of durability
"Samsung, habit is the reason, I assume that any other brand of android smart phones are just as good."
Samsung
"I am on Samsung S/Note series for a while now, I think at least 13 years. Switched back and forth between Note and S, but after having it all, landed on smallest S series phones, which is now more than capable of doing everything that I need. Why Samsung? I don't know honestly, but since I am in Europe, not all phones were available with the major carriers. Wanted to try Oneplus but never decided to give out that much money for a phone. Carrier renewed my contract every two years and with it gave me a huge discount on the phone. Stayed with one carrier throughout that period and basically the choice was then Samsung or Apple. 
In their defence, their S lines are excellent. I've resold every phone after two years for 2-3x what I paid for it. Camera is good, battery is usually inside those two years good. Never had any major issues (besides their own cpu). Fairly easy to transfer to a new phone, know where are things despite small changes. Like the design and the size."
"Been using a Huawei phone lately, and I’m honestly impressed. The battery lasts forever and the camera's surprisingly good."
"Samsung! The A or S even M & F/Z
I just like the variety of it & tools they implement in the phones!"
"I used to love my Sony phones, the form factor, expandable storage and the headphones jack are just great, but they're too expensive now."
"Pixel if you like photography and quirky google features (Bixby)

  
Otherwise to me, Apple is like the Toyota of phone. Nothing fancy. They implement tech once it becomes proven and desireable. They don't rush to innovate. It just works. You buy into the 'ecosystem'

I now own a Prius, 4Runner, and plan on getting a GR Corolla and eventually a nicer 4Runner."
"Orange, because of Tim Cookjobs"
"Has to be Samsung for me but it's complicated. 🤣 I've had a lot of brands but I won't mention the ones which no longer exist. 

My first smart phone was the iPhone and I was Apple until the 4S. I then switched to Android and fell in love with the ability to customise the hell out of my phone so I knew I'd never go back to iPhone! 

I was Samsung from the S7 Edge until the S23 Plus but wanted to go stock Android for a while so the Pixel 9 Pro XL was the phone to push me to make the switch. Love the stock Android experience... Didn't so much love the hardware after so many years with the speed and reliability of Samsung. 

Needless to say, the Pixel issues became too much after six months and I went back to Samsung, now on the S25 Plus. I can ot fault Samsung and their hardware. They really know how to build a solid device and on that front, they're up there with Apple. The Pixel definitely has the edge when it comes to software if you want a clean and seamless experience. But I'm afraid I don't think think their hardware or durability is quite there yet."
"I haven't yet owned two phones from the same brand (unless we consider pre-smartphones, in which case I've had three Samsungs now), but based on the experience I have had:

\- Huawei (some cheap circa 2012 phone): Was pretty impressive for the price. Though also, was my first smartphone so it was going to impress me no matter what. Replaced because I wanted something fancier.  
\- Samsung (Galaxy S3, Exynos version): Amazing phone. Only replaced because it got old.  
\- Meizu (M3 Note): Adequate. Nothing special, did the job. Replaced in the end because the charger port wore out, after earlier replacing it with the next one on this list as an ""upgrade"" but quickly switching back.  
\- Blackview (P10000 Pro): Extremely impressive battery. Literally everything else about it sucked ass - couldn't reliably connect to mobile networks, was sluggish, camera wasn't particularly great. Ended up getting rid of it and going back to the Meizu.  
\- Xiaomi (Redmi Note 7): Adequate. Ads in system apps were quite annoying. Otherwise, was good value for the price. Also replaced because the charger port wore out.  
\- Oppo (A94 5G): Very solid device, no complaints. Replaced due to update end-of-life.  
\- Apple (iPhone 12): Also very solid device, but a lot of the minor differences from Android still irritate me a bit even after \~6 months of using it. In particular I love how Apple Pay just works, every time, unlike Google Pay which was always a bit of a hassle. I would not have purchased an iPhone, but I won one in a contest and had it sitting in a drawer planning to sell it, then when I realised I needed a new phone, I was like ""screw it, let's just use that one"".

If I was buying a new phone now, it'd be a toss-up between Oppo and Samsung. I'm probably not buying another one until my current one either breaks or is no longer supported for updates though, and I think that's still quite a while off for this model."
"I always buy Motorola. Long battery life. Not much bloatware. The glass seems indestructible. I'm on my third phone in maybe 10 years and I have never chipped or broken the glass, even though I've dropped them a bunch of times. They are good enough for me. I don't know if the cameras are as good as others but I don't care because I don't take many pictures and never take selfies."
Apple but I recently switched to S25 ultra and Im loving it. Still preffer Apple over samaung but for now Im sticking with ultra line
iPhone FTW
"xiaomi, they are improving every year with some great specs and have stopped from just making budget phones with minimal specs"
"Apple, because I just don’t care about all the fancy features and like longevity. All my iPhones served me well for at least 5 years before I even considered to upgrade."
"Samsung, try my wife's iPhone from time to time and just hate the rudimentary software and lack of customisation. She loves it. Tried a few other Androids over the years(Sony, LG and xiaomi) but come back to Samsung s phones usually base models. Software is exemplary, great customisation through goodlock and all designed to work perfectly on their devices. Dex system is amazing to run a desktop mode from phone wireless or wired. The devices peaked with S9 and note 9 as still had sd card support and headphone jack. But hard to beat battery life gains with s25 snapdragon elite. My sons had A series phones and they also held up well over a few years."
Had many other smartphone brands over the years (even iPhone) and Samsung has by far been my favorite and I have been sold on them ever since. Seemed like all my smartphone issues stopped when I got my first Samsung which was a Note 5. I don't foresee that ever changing either.
"LG. because they made good phones for much lower prices. they stuck to their principles and offered value and useful innovation. I miss them. SamDung ended up just copying iPhoney since (or after) the Galaxy S6 and that was the end of me ever considering that brand. If Xioami or Huawei came to the US, i'd jump on their phones in a heartbeat. the phones we have in the US are complete CRAP. every year, there's less and less to choose from, less and less features, and i'm convinced that these major players are corning the market here to prevent competition. Asus, Motorola and Sony used to have good presence in the US but not anymore. all we have is garbage from SamDung, Crapple, Goober Pixel, and OneMinus. basically cookie cutter phones with all features stripped out of them. sorry for my rant but someone had to say it."
"Redmi 🫡

Budget Smartphones work for 4-5 yrs easily.

Custom Roms are Gem 💎 

Hardware Is Very Easily Available 🔝

For cameras google pixel but lots of bugs and heating issues."
"It used to be HTC, now its Samsung because ... whatever."
I have Samsung note 5 mobile. You tube app is not supported at this phone. Any reason or remedy. Pl share
I really miss my Sony phone. I had the Xperia 3?  X3?  Whichever the last one Verizon offered was. Switched to Motorola when they dropped Sony. Now I have a pixel 8pro. Which I love. But I'd love to have a new Sony phone more than anything
"Samsung, but working there creates an obvious bias"
"Xiaomi... Well, it's one of the chinese brands where you can get a flagship phone that is on a par with Samsung S variants. Plus it's 10x cheaper 👌🏻 as an Asian, buying cheaper saves more money than buying an expensive phone that breaks after 1 drop (like an iphone)."
Motorola Stylus
"OnePlus, innovation, cost for high performance with fantastic battery life and charging speeds. No need to have battery life PTSD when it charges so fast. Wide variety of first party accessories that all work very well. Their earbuds are phenomenal, charging options are incredible, cases are simple and effective and all very affordable without sacrificing a lot.


Been with them for years and plan on sticking around."
"A long while ago it was Motorola, then Google, then OnePlus before they became crap and when Google released the hot garbage that was the Pixel 4. Now it's back to Google.

All that to say probably Google. I just like the Pixel experience. They're good phones (other than the aforementioned Pixel 4)."
"I love my old Umidigi, lasted longer than any of my other phones."
"Motorola 


Stock Android. Affordable. Comes with charger and protective case. My G75 even came with a pair of Moto Buds."
"Unpopular opinion, but Nokia (HMD). They haven't made me switch to another brand because of the exceptional durability and irresistible prices for our region. Pixel UI on non-Tensor hardware, unlocked bootloaders on demand and simpler end-user repairs are additional bonuses. "

"I usually go for phones that offer reliable performance without burning a hole in my pocket. What matters most to me is a clean experience ,good screen, dependable battery, and no unnecessary bloat.

That’s why I am exploring new devices. Recently have come across V3 series from Alcatel, its really good phone with decent specs. They got the basics right, and provides great display along with AI integrated performance. Something that just works, keeps up with my day, and doesn't feel like a compromise."
I've always loved honor and also I have no idea why I just think it's a really polished and clean yet quite not known yet. Like a hidden gem
[removed]
Samsung it's because i love the Over the Horizon Ringtones is excellent for me 🥰
I only have brand(s) I would never (again) buy myself - Huawei and Apple.
"lg and nokia windows phones, blackberry, lg env3. current brands probably apple and google. windows phone was great at the time just needed more apps. i miss physical keyboards on phones like blackberry or the env3"
"Apple. First had it during 4S time and it was easy to navigate, and good for basic usage, communication and games. I dont do anything else w my phone. And icloud as well. Have years and years of stuff in there. So will just stick w iphone. Good for video, playing game and texting. 

4S, 6, 7P, XSM, 12PM, 14PM, 16PM"
iPhone since nothing can compare.
"I would be a huge OnePlus fan if the customer service was worth a damn. I had several times I had to contact support in regards to my 7 Pro and 9 Pro, and every single instance was either not resolved in one contact or just impossible for them to resolve.
I couldn't get them to send a correct quote for having my 7 Pro back glass and battery replaced. I talked to 5 agents and got 5 quotes all wrong none of them included the battery.
With 9 Pro, I pre-ordered but their preorder bonus was out of stock. The next day, I saw they had a different preorder bonus. I contacted support and was told unless I wanted to cancel I couldn't get my preorder bonus.
With my 9 Pro, I broke the display. Contacted support told them by order number and I had broken the display. I had paid for device protection at checkout. They had me send my phone to OnePlus directly instead of their insurance partner. I had to have it returned and start all over with their insurance partner. So they can sell their insurance partners services directly at checkout and they can take their cut, but they can't do the bare minimum when it comes time to use the services they make money by selling?"
Could you elaborate what you mean by 'hobby' here? Thanks
They’re one of the few phone companies I can actually see making drastic improvements over the years.
I love one plus hardware but the change/merge from oxygen os to colour is took away a lot of things i like about the software
"I had oneplus 12 last year, this year got the oppo find x8 (standard) - Audio quality is much better on the oppo - both for the speakers and for the in ear earphones. Very noticeable."
Can you elaborate on the hires audio?
Oneplus is spying on u change to iphone or samsung
"I loved the camera on my Pixel 2 XL, but man I had to RMA it 3 times. 
Screen burn in
After I lock the phone and the screen turns off, the display flashes white 
USB port failure"
What advantages do you get for those apps on a Pixel compared to any other Android phone?
But all the things you listed can be done on any android phone.
"Also deep in the Google ecosystem and have been for maybe a decade or more. 

However, it's Samsung for me despite owning three pixel generations, including the very first one when they were practically unheard of. 

Far more reliable and that little more refined I find. Deep inside I'm a pixel fanboy, but I just can't compromise unfortunately."
Same! 👊🏿
"You don't need a Google phone for that, just an Android. Pixels heat up, have a weak battery and noticeably weaker range than, for example, OnePlus. They should be the benchmark for an ideal Android phone, ... but they aren't."
what radar do you use? and is the app made for your radar/better than waze?
Blackberry torch was honestly one of the best phones I ever had. 
Thank you for sharing! I wish BlackBerry was still around. We need a third major mobile OS
I have the 9 pro
Is Red magic a part of Xiaomi? I'm aware of them but not very familiar with them since they aren't sold in my country
"Motorola is good. I haven't had any of their phones since the Droid Bionic and original Droid Razr (2011-2012) but I really like what they are doing these days with their hardware. I just wish they supported their devices longer. But otherwise, solid phones."
"Its a pity Motorola has not marketed themselves as good. Their pricing has been good, they are any day better than their counterpart category Xiaomi, Realme etc."
"I have good memories from Motorola in the software department, I used midranges and everything worked almost flawless.

Now, their quality control was always pretty bad. Specially related to screens. The last one I tried on a daily basis (partner and sister had the moto G60) were a big disappointment in every possible way.

I don't know if things have gotten better since they moved to amoled."
Are there stutters glitches bugs in the software.
That's totally understandable and fair. Thank you for sharing your thoughts on this.
"Same, I do some research and see what is best/fits my needs best.
I had HTC, Sony, LG and OnePlus 
I bought used phones for my last few generations and used Samsung phones are usually way overpriced."
Xperia play. G.O.A.T
"Sorry, I should've clarified, I meant out of the companies that are still around today. 

But yes Sony Ericson phones were legendary."
"I honestly wish BlackBerry and Windows phones were still around so that way we had 2 additional options when it comes to mobile software. I'm a lifelong Android user and I never had BlackBerry or iOS, but I've always respected them for what they bring to the table.."
My work used Blackberry till COVID
Dude started so strong then said he owns an iPhone 😂.
I've just bought a Pixel 8a for myself. It will arrive tomorrow. I'm a bit anxious as I've never used a Google (or any other brand) phone really - I've only used Sony Xperias.
Same!! 👊🏿
That's totally understandable. Thank you for sharing 🙂
"I lowkey want to switch to Sony but they don't sell the phones in my country (Korea) and B) I introduced someone I knew to their now wife and they now work at Samsung Electronics so I get free phones like once every 2 years and I can't argue with free tbh. 

I'm moving to the US for a few years soon and my current phone is about 2 years old and so switching to a Sony is really high on my list of considerations tbh"
I like their hardware! I wish they were sold here in the US still 😭
OnePlus phones seem really solid. I never had one but I like what they are doing with their hardware.
"These are solid choices! If the Pixel didn't exist, then OnePlus would definitely be my primary phone followed by Samsung or Motorola."
Unfortunately being here in the US I never had any experience with Xiaomi phones since they aren't sold here 😕 but they seem like solid phones
Thank you for sharing your thoughts on this. I'm a Google Pixel guy myself. I like Samsung's hardware though.
What drew you to OnePlus and Xiaomi phones? I'm pretty familiar with OnePlus but I have no experience with Xiaomi phones since they aren't sold here.
Thank you for sharing!
Not a bad company! OnePlus is pretty solid. I like what they're doing with their hardware. I'm thinking about getting the OnePlus buds one day
That's totally understandable. Thank you for sharing 🙂
I love Google's software approach the best.
Both of your statements are so sad to me. But thank you for sharing 🙂
I hear great things about Honor phones. They aren't sold here in the US unfortunately. How long do they typically support their devices?
"same! started 2015, bought 5 so far. but I am not so happy with the independent brand, was besltter with Huawei."
"Google in my opinion just needs to continue to hone in on their hardware. They are my preferred phones, but I always call them out for the things they need to work on. That being said, I never had any issues with the two Pixel phones I've owned so far (Pixel 2XL which I had for 5 years and my current Pixel 7 which I've had for almost 3 years now).  Google's software is what has me hooked on Pixels due to its clean software and consistent updates, it really keeps them running smooth and fluid for years and years. At least in my experience."
That's totally fair. Great points! Thank you so much for sharing 🙂
I like what OnePlus does with their hardware.
The Galaxy S6 was the only Samsung smartphone I've ever owned. I remember it having a really good camera for the time and the software was actually pretty snappy for a TouchWiz device. I had it for two years before switching to my beloved Pixel 2XL and I've been team Pixel ever since. I'm now on my 2nd Pixel device and I just can't over how great the software is.
Yeah it's really unfortunate how HTC and LG went away 😔
That's not a bad way of looking at it. Thank you for sharing your thoughts 🙂
That's totally understandable. Fair points!
Fair point! Thank you for sharing your thoughts on this.
"I never got a chance to try Huawei phones when they were available here in the US. Xiaomi phones were never sold here so I never had any experience with any of their products, but I hear good things about them. Which iPhone do you have now?"
That's totally fair. My first ever phone (pre-smartphone era) was a Samsung flip phone back in 2004. The only other Samsung phone I had was the Galaxy S6.
Absolutely 😎
That's a nice combo 👊🏿
I've been a Pixel fan since owning my beloved Pixel 2XL which I had for 5 years before upgrading to my current Pixel 7 which I got at launch. The clean software and the frequent and consistent software updates are what really makes me a fan of Google phones.
That's totally fait. Thank you for sharing your thoughts on this.
I never got a chance to try any of the Sony phones when they were available here in the US. I heard great things about them hardware wise.
Xiaomi phones aren't sold in my country so I unfortunately never had any exposure to them. But I hear great things about them.
"I appreciate you sharing your thoughts on this! I completely understand where you're coming from. I really like what OnePlus is doing with their hardware. I totally agree with you regarding Motorola. They have fantastic hardware but the lack of consistent software updates is really holding them back for me. If the Pixels didn't exist OnePlus would be my number one choice followed closely by Samsung only due to the support. I wish OnePlus phones were fully supported on all US carriers. I prefer the Pixel because of the timely and consistent software support and its clean OS. I've had two Pixel phones so far (my beloved Pixel 2XL and my current Pixel 7) and both of them have remained solid for years. These are the first phones I've owned that I didn't experience any slowdowns whatsoever after years of owning them. The only thing Google really needs to improve on is their hardware. I just want them to continue to work on the efficiency and power output of the Tensor Chips. Despite this, I haven't had any issues with performance over time. At least in my experience."
I really like what OnePlus is doing with their hardware! They seem to be really solid.
I am in the same boat. Is the OS a lot different and does it take long getting used to? Are there things you miss?
👊🏿 Google for the win 💪🏿
I've always been intrigued with Asus as a company and I want to learn more about their phones. What is their software policy? Like how long do they typically support their devices?
"Hey my friend, I truly appreciate you sharing your thoughts on this. I've never been an iPhone person but I definitely respect them for what they bring to the table. One of my favorite iPhones of all time is the 8 Plus. I think it's the best of the home button era of iPhones. I also really like the 13 Pro Max, that's easily one of the BEST phones Apple has ever made. It's just a really solid iPhone in all regards. 

Unfortunately I haven't had any experience with Xiaomi, Huawei, or Honor phones since they aren't sold here in the US. I'm a lifelong Android user (my first smartphone was in July 2010) so I've had 2 LG phones (LG Ally 3G, and LG G2) , 2 Motorola phones (Droid Bionic and Droid Razr) , and 1 Samsung phone (Galaxy S6) but since switching to my beloved Google Pixel 2XL back in the day, I've been hooked on Pixel devices. What I loved about Pixel phones is Google's software approach. It's clean, quick, and very well supported. Their hardware isn't as powerful as Samsung or Apple, but MAN the software really shines and it keeps the phone performing beautifully for years and years. I had my Pixel 2 XL for 5 years and it remained flawless the whole time I had it, I now have had my current Pixel 7 since launch and it's still solid almost 3 years later. I love what Google does with their software. They just need to continue to improve their hardware in my opinion."
That's awesome! I really like what OnePlus is doing with their hardware. That would be my first choice if the Pixel phones weren't a thing. I'm thinking about getting the OnePlus buds
Thank you for sharing your thoughts on this! I've been a Google Pixel fan since owning my beloved Pixel 2XL which I had for 5 years before trading it in for my current Pixel 7 at launch. Both phones have been phenomenal for me.
OnePlus is definitely something I'm interested in. I love what they are doing with their hardware. If the Pixel didn't exist then the OnePlus followed closely by Samsung Galaxy S series phones would definitely be my phone of choice. I'm planning on getting the Pixel watch 3XL or 4XL as well as the OnePlus buds soon.
Same!
I can attest to this!
"I've always wanted to try a Sony phone. Unfortunately they are no longer sold here in the US 😔 
I like Sony products."
Those are FIRE! I REALLY like what OnePlus is doing with their hardware. I'm thinking about getting the OnePlus buds one day.
"I totally feel you on that. Ever since owning my beloved Pixel 2XL which was my first Pixel phone, the software is what made me fall in love with Pixel devices. I like how you get timely and consistent software updates and how clean the OS is. I know other phones may have better hardware but the software of the Pixel phones to me is top notch."
Thank you so much for sharing your thoughts on this 🙂
That's totally understandable 🙂
I'm totally with you on that! My first Google phone was my beloved Pixel 2XL which I had for 5 years before upgrading to my current Pixel 7 and it worked flawlessly the whole time I had it. This was the first experience I've had with a phone  whose software remained smooth and snappy as day 1. So far my Pixel 7 has been pretty solid for almost 3 years now. No hiccups whatsoever. I love the clean software of Pixel phones as well as the timely and consistent updates.
"Thank you for sharing! My very first smartphone was an LG Ally 3G (Verizon) way back in 2010. I also had one other LG phone which was the LG G2. I wish they were still around for competition sake. They had some innovative phones for sure, but they just couldn't be consistent in their vision or their marketing."
Sony is one of the few brands I definitely wouldn't mind trying if they were available again here in my country.
"Motorola is doing great things with their hardware! I like what they have to offer. I only wish they supported their devices longer. But for the price point, I really can't complain too much about them."
Thank you for sharing 🙂
That's totally fair and understandable. I don't have any experience with Xiaomi phones since they aren't sold in my region. But for some reason I've always been interested in Asus and what they have to offer. They seem like pretty solid phones.
"I hear great things about Honor. I wish they were officially sold here in the US. I like what they are doing with their hardware. I've seen Magic OS, but I'm not very familiar with it. What is their software update policy like on their phones?"
That's totally fair. Thank you for sharing 🙂
"Thank you so much for sharing your thoughts on this. I had a Nokia flip phone back in 2007-2009 and I absolutely loved that phone. This was one of my last phones before getting my very first smartphone in the summer of 2010. Glad Nokia phones are still serving you well, my friend 🙂"
That's totally fair. What was your favorite iPhone so far?
"I absolutely LOVED my Pixel 2XL. That phone was responsible for making me a pixel fan. I had that phone for 5 years and it worked flawlessly the whole time I had it. I upgraded to the Pixel 7 which I got a launch and it's been solid for me for almost 3 years now. 

I'm sorry to hear that happened to your 6 Pro 😐"
The P30 was legendary 🔥🔥🔥
Nice list 👍🏿🙂
I personally haven't experienced many bugs with my Pixel phones (my beloved 2XL and my current P7) but I know many have.
I wish Sony phones were still available here in the US
Same! My beloved Pixel 2XL which was my first Google phone is what made me a pixel fan. I prefer Pixels due to the software.
I'm with you in that. I really like Google's software approach.
"Thank you for sharing your thoughts on this! I've been hooked on Pixels since owning my beloved Pixel 2XL which I had for 5 years before upgrading to my current Pixel 7 at launch. Both phones have been fantastic software and performance wise. The software is what caused me to become a fan. I'm looking to upgrade to either the Pixel 10 Pro XL later this year or wait until the 11 series comes out next year. So far my Pixel 7 has been rock solid for me. I just want a bigger display, an ultrasonic fingerprint scanner, and a more efficient chipset and modem for my next phone."
"I haven't had one in years. But from what I've seen, they basically make pro level digital cameras that can also make phone calls and connect wirelessly to the Internet. And I'm down for that."
That's a fair point. I've been a Pixel fan since owning my beloved Pixel 2XL. The biggest reason is due to the frequent and consistent software updates. I also like Google's software approach. I'm on my second Pixel now (Pixel 7) which I've had since launch and it's been nothing but solid for me so far. I'm looking to upgrade possibly next year when the 11 series comes out.
"Thank you for sharing! I never had a chance to try any of the blackberry phones as I didn't get my first smartphone until summer 2010 going into my sophomore year of college. By the time I became familiar with smartphones, BlackBerry was already on its way out sadly. But I do wish they or Windows phones were still around. We need a third major mobile OS around"
That's totally fair. I never had any experience with Xiaomi phones since they aren't sold in my country. But I hear great things about them hardware wise.
I currently have the Pixel 7. I've had it since launch and it's been solid for me so far. No issues. I plan to upgrade either to the 10 Pro XL later this year or the 11 Pro XL next year.
"I like what they do with their hardware. If the Pixel phones didn't exist, then OnePlus followed closely by Samsung Galaxy S series phones would be my primary choice."
"I'm with you regarding the Google ecosystem and the clean software of the Pixel phones. This is why I've become a Pixel fan since owning my beloved Pixel 2XL which I had for 5 years. I now have the Pixel 7 which I got at launch and it's still rock solid performance wise. The clean software and the consistent updates keeps it well optimized for years. 

I like Samsung's hardware better though. But otherwise the Pixel phones are my preference."
"I hear a lot about Vivo's camera prowess. I never had any experiences with Vivo, Oppo, Xiaomi, or Huawei phones since they aren't sold in my country, but I hear great things about their hardware."
"I only had 2 Motorola phones but that was in a different era of the company. It was the Motorola Droid Bionic and the original Droid Razr. 

I've been team Pixel since owning my beloved Pixel 2XL which I had for 5 years. That was the first phone that I kept that long due to how well optimized the software remained over time. I upgraded to the Pixel 7 at launch and almost 3 years later it's still going strong. I like Google's software approach the best."
"This is a great list bro! Thank you so much for sharing your thoughts on this. I never had any of OnePlus products but I'm pretty intrigued by them. I'm a Pixel guy myself, but I wouldn't mind getting a OnePlus phone. I actually am interested in getting the OnePlus buds along with the upcoming Pixel watch 4. I'm looking to either upgrade from my current Pixel 7 to the upcoming Pixel 10 Pro XL this year or wait for the 11 Pro XL next year. So far my Pixel 7 has been holding up pretty well and I've had it for almost 3 years now."
Thank you for sharing! 🙂
Those are all fair points. Thank you for sharing!
What’s your iOS version? iOS 13?
Thank you for sharing!
"Nice, thank you for sharing."
GL with that one
"Except wireless charging, sony xperia"
"Samsung and Google now support their flagship devices (and in the case of Google even their midrange devices) for 7 years. Google just added two additional years of OS support for their 6 and 7 series phones which is awesome! 

But I hear you regarding iOS and the lack of fragmentation. I respect Apple for that even if I don't like them. I respect what they do well."
How well is it holding up? I've had my Pixel 7 since launch and so it's been rock solid for me so far. I had my beloved Pixel 2XL for 5 years before this phone and it was fantastic. Loved that phone.
I've never used an Asus device but I really like what they do with their gaming phones.
PRC spyware installed? No thanks.
Same here! Ever since owning my beloved Pixel 2XL which I had for 5 years I've been hooked on Pixels. I now have the Pixel 7 which I've had since launch and it's been rock solid for me for almost 3 years now. It's Pixel for me for the foreseeable future.
That's what's up. What made you switch?
Those are all very fair points. Thank you for sharing 🙂
Nothing wrong with that at all. Unfortunately I can't get Xiaomi phones in my country
"Thank you for sharing your thoughts. Being in the US I never had any experience with Xiaomi, Honor, Huawei, Oppo, Sony, or Vivo since they aren't sold here. Sony used to back in the day but not anymore"
I unfortunately never had the opportunity to try Huawei phones when they were available here in the US. But I hear a lot of great things about them hardware wise.
Cool 😎
That's totally understandable. Thank you for sharing 🙂

Man I'm sorry to hear you had that experience with the Pixel. I've had two Pixel phones so far and both of them have been solid for me. My first Pixel was my beloved Pixel 2XL which I had for 5 years and it remained flawless performance wise the whole time I had it. I have had my Pixel 7 since launch and almost 3 years later it's still rock solid for me.
I completely get where you're coming from. I really like Sony's hardware. I wish they were still available in my country.
That's totally fair. Thanks for sharing your thoughts.
"I really like what Motorola and OnePlus is doing with their hardware. My only knock against Motorola is that they don't support their devices very long. Otherwise, I like what they are doing. If the Pixel didn't exist then OnePlus would be first choice followed closely by Samsung's Galaxy S series phones, though I prefer the software of OnePlus more. But the Pixel phones are my favorite because I really like their software."
"That's totally fair. I've only had two Motorola Droid phones (Droid Bionic and the originally Droid Razr). I also had two LG phones (LG Ally 3G which was my very first smartphone, and the LG G2) and 1 Samsung phone (Galaxy S6) but ever since moving to the my beloved Pixel 2XL which I had for 5 years before upgrading to my current Pixel 7 at launch, I've been hooked on Pixel phones. I really like Google's software approach when it comes to their phones."
"I really like what OnePlus is doing with their hardware. If the Pixel didn't exist, OnePlus and Samsung's Galaxy S series phones would be my choice."
That's totally fair. I like Samsung's hardware. Thank you for sharing your thoughts on this :)
I wish they were still available here in the US.
This is a very valid point here. Samsung does seem to do this the best in the Android world. Thank you for sharing your thoughts!
"I hear great things about Oppo, which if I'm not mistaken is the parent company of OnePlus? I unfortunately never had any experience with Oppo phones since they aren't sold here in the US. But I like what they are doing with their hardware."
"That's totally fair. Thank you for sharing your thoughts on this my friend! I've never been an iPhone person but I do have a 10th Gen iPad that I love using for media consumption, I also have a MacBook that I use for work, but when it comes to mobile I've always preferred Android, specifically Google Pixel phones. I understand why people love them, especially here in the US, but they just aren't for me. Again thank you for sharing your thoughts! I enjoyed reading your take on this."

Solid phones indeed. If Pixels didn't exist then OnePlus or Samsung Galaxy S series phones would be phones of choice no doubt.

I'm so sorry to hear that. I've had two Pixel devices so far and both were pretty solid for me. But I completely understand where you're coming from. Thank you sharing 🙂
I hear good things about Xiaomi's hardware. Never had any experience with any of their phones since they aren't sold in my country.
Thank you for sharing :)
"This is a great list here! I never had any experience with Xiaomi phones since they aren't sold here in the US, but I hear great things about their hardware."
That's definitely a fair point. This is why I personally prefer Google Pixel phones because of the clean software.
Yeah it's sad how Huawei got banned here in the US. I never had the chance to try any of their products when they were available here.
Thank you for sharing! Samsung is a pretty well-rounded brand. I appreciate how they have so many phones available for different price points.
What market are you in? Xiaomi phones aren't available in my market so I never had any experience with them.
That's totally fair and understandable. Thank you for sharing your thoughts on this.
I unfortunately never had the chance to try Huawei phones when they were available here in the US. But I've heard great things about them.
"That's very fair. I'm a Pixel fan, but I've always called them out for their hardware. They really need to step it up when it comes to the Tensor Chip and the modem. From what I hear, Google is FINALLY ditching Samsung for TSMC to make the Tensor G5 chip. I also hear that Google is moving to MediaTek's flagship modem as well. I'm really hoping this helps the Pixel become more efficient and a little more powerful. I'm honestly not expecting a huge power boost, but I do hope for better efficiency."
"If they did, that would be DOPE 🔥"

What issues did you have with the S22 Ultra?
"I never had the opportunity of owning a Sony phone when they were sold here in my country but I hear great things about their hardware. I've had 2 LG phones, 2 Motorola phones, and 1 Samsung phone, but none of them were as special as my beloved Google Pixel 2XL. That phone changed the game for me and I've been team Pixel ever since. I'm on my 2nd Pixel device now the Pixel 7 which I've had since launch, and 3 years later it's been rock solid for me. I am planning to upgrade either later this year for the Pixel 10 Pro XL or (more likely) wait next year for the 11 Pro XL."
Thank you for sharing :)
That's totally fair. Thank you for sharing 🙂
Thank you for answering. Samsung is a well-rounded brand for sure.
Those are all valid points and totally fair. Thank you for sharing your thoughts on this! 🙂
This is a solid choice. I totally understand where you're coming from.
That's totally fair.
I recently moved on from my 2010 Tacoma which I had for almost a little over 15 years. It was trouble free. The only reason I finally got rid of it was because of the axels and wheel joints were too expensive to repair after much wear and tear.  But in terms of the engine and transmission it was bullet proof! I know have a 2021 Tacoma and plan to keep it for a while and trade it in for a Tundra one day hopefully. I'm Toyota for life.
Moto fan for life❤ too.
"That's totally fair. I really like what Motorola is doing with their hardware. I only had two Motorola phones (Droid Bionic and the Droid Razr) but this of course was in the very early days. I'm now a Pixel fan myself, but I like Motorola's hardware and price points."
I had my z3 for 7 years. Battery life started shitting itself. Then a ceramic plate fell edge first on to my screen. Killed it. I mean shattered. So now I've switched to pixel 8pro because I didn't like any of the Motorola phones Verizon was offering
"That's totally fair. Thank you for sharing! I've always been an Android guy when it comes to mobile, but I don't mind the iPad or the Macbook. I have a 10th Gen iPad that I love for streaming, playing casual games, and occassional Zoom calls."
Thank you for sharing your thoughts!
Thank you for sharing your thoughts! I unfortunately have no experience with Xiaomi phones since they aren't available here in my country. But I hear great things about their hardware.
"That's totally fair, that's how I feel about Pixel phones. They have clean software and are very well supported with updates and seem to perform very well for years and years. I had my beloved Pixel 2XL for 5 years and it remained flawless the whole time I had it. I didn't have a single issue with that phone. I only upgraded to my current Pixel 7 because Google stopped updating it. But lately, Google is supporting their phones for much longer now and I really appreciate that. My Pixel 7 is almost 3 years old and it's been rock solid."
"Thank you so much for sharing your thoughts on this, my friend. I'm a lifelong Android user (first smartphone was an LG Ally 3G (Verizon) I got back in the summer 2010 going into my sophomore year of college). I've had 2 LG phones (2nd being the LG G2), 2 Motorola phones (Droid Bionic and Droid Razr) and only 1 Samsung phone (Galaxy S6) but have since settled with Google phones with the first being my beloved Pixel 2XL. So I never had an iPhone as my daily driver. My wife on the other hand is an iPhone user and every time I use it, I can't stand how iOS navigates. I do have a 10th Gen iPad which I like for video streaming, casual games, and the occasional Zoom calls and I have a MacBook that I use for work, but those are the only two Apple products that I have. But when it comes to mobile, I've always preferred Android over iOS."
That's totally understandable! I've only had one Samsung phone and that was the Galaxy S6 which I had for two years. I really liked the hardware and it had a pretty solid camera (though this has never been my top priority when it comes to phones because I don't take many pictures). The only thing that annoyed me about that phone was the battery life near the end of my time with it was ATROCIOUS. I also grew annoyed with some of the duplicate apps that were unnecessary. I also realize that this was before the OneUI days so I know things are different now. But otherwise it was a pretty good phone. I went from that phone to my beloved Pixel 2XL and I became a Google Pixel fan ever since due to their software. I do like Samsungs hardware though.
"No need to apologize at all. I really appreciate you sharing your thoughts on this. I think topics like this need to be discussed and we as consumers need to be honest with these companies. I'm a lifelong Android user and sadly only had 2 LG phones (the LG Ally 3G (Verizon) which was my very first smartphone (July 2010)  and the LG G2 (2014 to early 2015). I really enjoyed those phones. Unfortunately, my G2 was only great for 8 months. The screen calibration went absolutely HAYWIRE to the point it became unusable. I got a replacement G2 and sadly the same thing happened about 3 months in. I was devastated because I really liked that phone. I never went back with LG after that. Afterwards, I went with the Samsung Galaxy S6 which was my only Samsung phone. I had that phone for 2 years before finally settling on Google. The Pixel 2XL was the phone that was responsible for making me a Pixel fan. I had that phone for 5 years and it remained flawless for me all 5 years of owning it. The clean software and frequent and consistent OS updates is what keeps me coming back. I now have the Pixel 7 which I got at launch and almost 3 years later, the OS is still smooth and running well with virtually no hiccups. 

I do wish LG and HTC were still making phones and I wish Sony still sold phones in the US. I never got a chance to try any HTC or Sony phones where they were available. I did have two of the early Motorola phones (Droid Bionic and the OG Droid Razr) though. This was before I was really informed about the larger phone market. Knowing what I know now, I definitely would've went HTC, Sony, and Nexus back in the day."
"I hear a lot about Xiaomi's Redmi line. Unfortunately, being in the US I haven't had any experience with any of their products since they aren't sold here."
Yeah it's really sad how HTC went away. I wish they and LG were still around.
I wish had the chance to try Sony phones when they were sold here. I like their hardware. I've been a Pixel user since my beloved Pixel 2XL which was my first Google phone. I'm now on my second Pixel phone (Pixel 7) since launch.
Lol I completely understand. Thank you for sharing your thoughts on this.
"I hear a lot about Xiaomi phones but never had any experience with them since they aren't sold in my country. But I hear great things about their hardware. I've never been an iPhone person.

Both phones have been fantastic in my experience. The clean software and  frequent updates keep them working great for years."

"Lol that's totally fair. I still use my Galaxy Tab E from 2016 as my alarm clock and I really like the ""Beginning"" ringtone tone lol"
What was your experience like with those two? I'm interested.
I really wish BlackBerry or Windows phones were still around. It would be great if we had at least 3 major mobile operating systems around.
I've owned so many Apple products going back to the early Macs but I don't use iPhones because of the mediocre Bluetooth audio. I guess we Hi-Res fans are too small a market for them to be of concern to them.
Thank you for sharing 🙂
Yes. I wish they had US based service. They did replace my 1st phone after much back and forth. Those weren't really ready for prime time.
I second this. I returned OP10T due to this couple weeks after purchase and won't be dealing with this company anymore. Every promo they advertised with a purchase didn't work as it was advertised and it was impossible to get any help from customer service. It felt like they were pulling bait and switch.
"I loved my OnePlus 7T. The specs, features and UI for their price was insane. Mine died out out of the blue but my experience with my phone was excellent. Wanted to buy their newer model but ever since their merge with Oppo, the prices rose and the specs dropped. And OnePlus is the leading brand with green lines issues so I had give up on it."
So much to play with in the developer options .  I adjust the audio settings often.  Their 1st phone was really a work in progress.
I started with Cyanogen OS. It was challenging but fun. Oxygen is more stable. We haven't gotten ColourOS in the US.
I'm in California. I've not seen oppo available here. I'll give it a look. Audio quality is important for me.
OnePlus supports all the hi-res codecs available for me to stream. Apple limits iphones to aac.
It sounds like your phone is defective. I got my Pixel 7 Pro at launch and it hasn't given me a day of trouble. It doesn't even get hot when charging anymore.
"I know the 2XL has screen issues which were widely known at the time. But that was my first Pixel phone and the one that made me a Pixel fan for the foreseeable future. I had that phone for 5 years and it remained flawless performance wise the whole time I had it. The clean software and the consistent updates is what I believe makes Pixel phones so smooth and reliable for years and it's why I fell in love with Google's software approach. 

I'm now on my 2nd Pixel device which is the Pixel 7 which I've had since launch and almost 3 years later, it's still rock solid. I haven't had any issues with this phone except the fingerprint scanner and sometimes the battery life isn't the best on 5G but otherwise, it's been a great device. I am looking forward to upgrading to either the Pixel 10 Pro XL or the 11 Pro XL next year because I want a bigger display, and a more efficient modem and chipset"
I rocked my Pixel 2XL for 4 years. It was a beast... and why I ended back up with a Pixel 7 after a OnePlus 9
"But is the integration between Google apps as seamless on other Android devices? The phone, contacts and messages apps effectively work as one. Some examples: a contact app shortcut can call or message anyone in the contacts app. The phone app can search for contacts and send messages. The messages app can search for contacts and make calls. Contact addresses are automatically linked to the maps app. The calendar app is automatically linked to the maps, contacts and, Google Drive apps. The messages app is automatically linked to the Gmail app. The Contacts app is automatically linked to the Gmail app. The phone app can create and add new contacts to the contacts app. Etc."
"When it comes to Android and not really into gaming, then it mostly boils down to UI, Software update and integration and Pixel is top tier with these aspects."
">However, it's Samsung for me despite owning three pixel generations, including the very first one when they were practically unheard of. 

My previous phone was the Galaxy S9+. I just dislike their UI design and unnecessary Samsung apps taking up storage space. 

>Far more reliable and that little more refined I find.

Fortunately, my Pixel experience has be virtually flawless. The 120 Hz screen is amazing, and the battery life for me is way better than it was with the S9+. For me, the Pixel is perfect because I'm not a power user and the experience thus far has been fantastic."
">Pixels heat up, have a weak battery and noticeably weaker range

This hasn't been my experience aside from the phone getting very warm which charging (which has since been resolved). Plus, the Pixel has a better camera than their biggest Android competitors."
"Uniden R8 tied in with my Samsung S23 Ultra. Only use waze for directions these days. Highway Radar takes the rather thin distance and expands it to whatever you wish. I have mine display markings at 1/2 mile , one mile, 3 miles, 5 miles and ten miles. Waze is limited currently to showing only 1/2 mile out while my detector has gotten up to a 4 mile warning. 
I do keep an R7 in my wife's SUV but will switch them out with my R8 when I'm taking a road trip in her SUV. R7 is good, R8 is just a bit better and that whole Bluetooth to my phone. 

[four mile warning ](https://youtu.be/vzAK8ymfNuM?si=87UtEPXre6ibzgcJ)

Just took my MX-5 on a shot road trip to to get a soda, 60 miles away. Sure, my fridge is stocked and there are plenty of places along the way but it is the 130 mile trip that is more interesting (I like to drive). Plus my mother in law is visiting... Still helped me warn about threats ahead since I generally try to keep around 95 mph avg with both highway radar and my R8 blasting away.

Oh, still ticket free"
No it's a sub brand of Nubia
"Yeah, that's one of the areas that holds them back. Although I do see more Motorola phones in the wild than I see Pixel phones. At least here in the US."
"From time to time, nothing massively annoying."
Thank you for sharing your thoughts my friend.
"Current phones would have to be
Samsung. All aspects are top notch."
Windows mobile was pretty cool too. I had one of the pre-touchscreen Windows Mobile smartphones (Motorola Q9h Global) and it was unique for sure. But Blackberry was a much better user experience to me.
"Oh WOW, I didn't know BlackBerry was still being used by that point. Very interesting indeed."
"iPhone may be my current phone, but I’ve owned phones of every major OS over the last 20 years. Palm. Windows. Blackberry. Android. iOS. I don’t owe any one platform my loyalty or hatred. They’ve all been great in their own ways."
Oh nice! I'd love to hear your thoughts on the software whenever you get some substantial time with it. I'm still on the Pixel 7 which I've had since launch and it's been solid for me for almost 3 years now.
It's worth it for Call Screening alone. Game changer.
Sony Xperia isn't a brand phone?
"That doesn't stop me ;) Just order from a Canadian or European site and then when you get the phone set it for English. The only gotcha is to make sure that the phone supports the same 5G frequencies as whatever US carrier you are using. 

I've been doing this for years - even when Sony \*did\* sell them in the states because other countries versions of the Sony phones had cooler colors."
"They're brilliant phones but I've just had an issue with the oneplus 12 that affected me with the oneplus 8 the screens are so fragile and expensive, drop them once and if you're unlucky they will never work again, with a green line across the screen"
"I feel kind of the same way 😊 if OnePlus didn't exist Pixel would be my main phone. I'm addicted to the fast charging/battery life and how customizable the OS is on OnePlus, but certain Pixel features like call screening and Hold For Me just can't be beat. Plus both brands have the best haptics around IMO. Motorola just makes great all-around devices for the price."
"Dude, they release their ultra as a global version. What's stopping you? Typed on my Vivo x200 Pro in the USA."
Xiaomi phones have their own problems. It's not worth it in the long run.
"Xiaomi have shytty software, one plus is much better for a chinese phone."
"Quite similar when I drew to them back then, just currently, in terms of camera, Xiaomi has the edge over OnePlus, but OnePlus bit better in terms of updates if using China ColorOS ROM, that's my personal opinion from using their last year's flagship OnePlus 12 and Xiaomi 14 ultra, but somehow I don't know, I'm bit incline towards OnePlus, maybe because their AI, not saying OnePlus get the total victory over XiaoMi in terms of AI integration, I'm not hardcore phone user by the way."
7 years for their latest 7 pro line
Last lg i had was the g4
"The 4K screen of the Sony Xperia 1 was gorgeous and I loved the 21:9 aspect ratio. Couldn't knock the hardware but the camera processing was very poor compared to the equivalent iPhone, Samsung and Pixel phones."
"I'm really okay with the Tensor chip.  Its not a big deal to me that it doesn't hit the benchmarks that Snapdragon does.  I just think Google should adjust prices for it because that Tensor is likely much cheaper than a Snapdragon.

I'm on AT&T and my only issue is a lack of wifi calling.  I don't use it but I would like the option.  US Mobile has also launched a service that allows coverage across all three of the big networks."
"I use Nova launcher, when I cloned my samsung S24 ultra to my OP12, it worked seamlessly the same.
Going into settings and making some nice options only made me happy. Camera is sd superior, battery is amazing"
These days any android phone have at least 4-5 years. Also now there is negligible change in the OS. So even after they stop supporting it can still go 2-3 years more.
"Yeah google really needs tuning on the hardware lol

U know what I like in pixel os? Sometimes it does shit I dont know why or how but its great, like once I was at an airport and my gate number showed up on the always on screen like how did that get there I dunno but thank you hell yeah"
Yeah the old Xperia models stood out from the crowd. Sadly they don't sell any more in my country as well.
"Absolutely, Edge series still gets better updates than G series. However currently I am unsure whether which device to go for as almost all new devices by motorola are with curved display. I  hate it lol"
"It's a shame Asus didn't keep making compact phones, now they offer nothing interesting or differentiating in the market, just another 6.8"" slab that costs +1000€/$. And their camera are still not good. Video stabilization was from another world on ZF9/10, truly obliterating competition."
13 Pro Max
"Thank you for the commiserations on losing my 6 Pro. 
And agree with you that the 2XL was superb. Used it for 5 years, and worked great pretty much for the entirety."
"I'm still rocking my Xperia 1 One, but it's showing its age, can't wait for the 7 to be available."
All of those are very true words ;)
"Only Premium Segement Phones are good, my phone is just in middle segment and its Okay but UI is still bad for me as I like clean OS."
"I am on 18.5 and i am just fine. No lags, no bugs."
"Didn't really say why but I've been a fan of Samsung since the original Galaxy S device. Apple, I have the ecosystem and enjoyed early technology. 

I'm starting to like Google because of the Pixel 9 Pro XL, but it's too early to tell."
"You’re totally right, I forgot about that! Will edit."
"It didn't say even an ouch! No hangs, saves battery for 12 hours straight working and using battery saver you can use it for about a full day. Veri nice screen, not bad of a camera but I've seen better on Samsung, google ecosystem makes ux much better!!! Only problems which I am not bothered are getting hot and not optimized for heavy games (20-30 FPS on ultra setting 8n genshin impCt)."
"I've never used their gaming flagships, only their gaming mid end (the Zenfone Max Pro M1). Imo, one of the best phone in terms of bang for buck at its time."
They are exceptional phones. Excellent hardware and performance. I also had to switch to a different brand due to the Google ban and even with flagship devices I feel they underperfome compared to Huawei
Your welcome. Just make sure you stick to your guns! Don't let anyone influence you otherwise. If you want to be loyal to something then be! That's just my generic experience with brands and communities around them lol. 
"The thing is average users also dont want to stick to a phone for more than 3,4 years. For me i get 3 Android major upgrades on a midranger, in my opinion my money has returned the value already."
The Bionic and Razr were cool phones as well. I miss my Droid Maxx. Loved that thing. It was replaced with a Motorola Z2 Play. Wasn’t a big fan but it got the job done. Held on to that until I got the Pixel 3a. Was solid right up to when I jumped over to Apple. Keep enjoying your Pixel 7. 👍
"I didn't know that about Oneplus, although it now makes sense as to why the Oneplus buds Pro 3, are the same as Oppo Enco X3's! . Thanks for the info."
"Forgot the ""why"" part lol

I like Samsung because of OneUI and its customizability. I also like the other products, like the Galaxy Ring, Watch, and tablets. Lastly, the fact that other Android accessories like those made by Google can work seamlessly with Galaxy phones is a huge plus.

I like Google for all the same reasons, but Samsung wins for the customizability of OneUI through GoodLock"
:D
You're welcome
Yeah just same with any Chinese phones in the US. Great hardware but no repair service as well as limited bands. If you can live with that and slower updates than Google/Samsung (though Samsung's one UI 7 rollout was terrible) I'd give them a chance. Some people have privacy concerns with Chinese phones and the information but imo it's probably fine 🤷🏾‍♂️🤣
I had the huawei p20 lite and it was such a good budget phone
"Azerbaijan where Iphone and Samsung extremely high. Samsung wasnt always like that in my country. We use to buy everything samsung. Phones,tv,tablets,fridge,washmachine. Now they are extremely high that people ignore that its actually exist.  I still love samsung tho LOL"
Pixel is like 90% of the way there.   They just need to focus on the small details and they could be a great manufacturer.
welcome
"Verizon's selection of Motorola sucks, but you can order one direct from Motorola for their network."
You’re welcome
Good to know :) I am considering giving Pixel a try once it’s official in my country.
No Xiaomi ? Meaning chinese products banned ?
I believe you can still buy them in the states. Just have to order direct from Sony. Which has been my problem. I'm a poor. So I'm stuck with whatever options the evil overlords will finance and overcharge me for to lock me into a 3 year contract
I think build quality and software combine currently google apple and samsung are the three that have good overall scores other brands have niche areas that excel but brands need to create products will good overall experiences
The overall hardware is good. Better than some expensive fragile ones. The software is shit. My DND doesn't work properly (redmi note 13) and they downgraded my super fast charging to fast charging after updating from android 13 or before the hyper Os update. Not all devices are supported when using the blasted IR. It takes 5-10 minutes to restart it.
The buds 3 and Buds Pro 3 are incredible. Bass cannons with fantastic auto and the touch controls especially for volume swipe are available on both versions
"I had the original Pixel XL, loved it, and when I was considering replacing it, that's when the 4 came out. That's when I switched to OnePlus. Now I'm back to Google with the Pixel 7 Pro and love it."
About 5 years and upgraded because the battery started to get a bit tired and I needed NFC but it still works well enough for me to use it every day and has a better display than my more recent phone - It's the Umidigi A11 - can't say anything about other versions of the brand but there are many and a lot of reviews. I prefer it to my more recent phone which is a Doogee rugged phone - wouldn't recommend Doogee.
"It's not that I would have a bad experience with the Huawei, but with the bans in place, I can't see them (officially) support functions I want. And Apple is just too restrictive and not really that user friendly (as opposed to what many apple fans claim)."
"windows phone looked so much better than ios and android, easy to use. the htc 8x was and is my favorite phone."
"I know what you mean. I’ve used Apple products for years, but honestly, I’m getting tired of them. The Bluetooth audio on iPhones isn’t great, especially for those of us who care about high-quality sound. These days, I just stick to a Nokia  phone. I’m not a big fan of using my phone for everything—I just want something simple that works well for what I need."
"They merged colour into oxygen after the 8pro or so. Part of Oppo bringing oneplus into its main line or something. Changed a lot of what I considered big qol features. Can’t remember exactly now it’s been a few years

Edit i just checked and while they share a codebase the unified os approach was abandoned not long after the initial push"
I got my standard Pixel 7 at launch as well and it's been rock solid for me so far.
YESSS!
"S23 Ultra here since pre release. Those things you mentioned are no longer major issues, though I also shared your same concerns which drove me to Google back in 2015 or so with the nexus line ups pre Pixel. 

Pixels are great and I'd love one again and often find myself wanting to move back but I just can't. Lol."
"95?? 😭😭 I thought I was speedster, rip your fuel economy 😂. I had an R7 but it’s gone now, not sure how I feel about dumping that much money into a radar again but I know it saved my ass a ton. Odd but what soda requires a 60 mile drive, better give you wings or something"
Gotcha. Thank you for educating me on this. I'll add Nubia to the list.
I thought it was Nokia misspelt
Thanks for sharing 🙏🏿
That's very interesting!
"Wow you just reminded me, I had that phone as well for a while. I bought an unlocked version and flashed it to cricket mobile and used it for a while before getting a fully touchscreen phone."
"Sme here, P7 for almost 3 years. It's such a great phone, I haven't really found a reason to switch to a P9"
"Call screening? Is that where the phone can label some calls as spam. If yes, it might be an Android feature rather than a Pixel-specific feature, as my old Xperia can do the same."
Good point.
Man I'm sorry to hear that 😕
I really like what OnePlus is doing with their hardware! I'm actually thinking about getting the OnePlus buds one day.
I didn't know that! That's good to know
Is this from a software standpoint?
I really like what OnePlus is doing with their phones. The software seems really solid as well. In fact if the Pixel didn't exist OnePlus would be my phone of choice followed by Samsung
Not anymore
Hyper os is trash and bloat that xiaomi has with integrated ads is insufferable.
That's awesome! It's so good to see other Android manufacturers supporting their devices longer. It's a great time to be an Android user.
Mine was the LG G2. In fact my very first smartphone was the LG Ally 3G (Verizon) back in July 2010
"My very first smartphone was the LG Ally 3G (Verizon) back in July 2010. It had a slide out keyboard and 4 physical buttons on the bottom front of the screen (home, back, menu, end call) lol. It was a good phone. The 2nd and last LG phone I had was the G2 and I absolutely loved that phone and it was GREAT.... until sadly it wasn't... About 8 months into my time with it, the touch screen calibration went absolutely HAYWIRE. It would ghost touch all over the place to the point where it wasn't usable anymore... I got it replaced with another G2 and the same thing happened to that phone about 3 months in so I moved on. It's sad because I really loved that phone 😔"
Yeah I'm so glad to see Android manufacturers supporting their devices longer now. It's a great time to be an Android user.
"Lol see what I mean, it's the little things that the Pixel phones do that I truly appreciate. They are so convenient. It truly feels like a real assistant."
"So when I upgraded from my beloved Pixel 2XL to my current Pixel 7, I originally wanted to go with the 7 Pro, but I decided to go with the regular 7 because of the curved display on the 7 Pro. I'm glad Google has done away with them the last two years. When I upgrade this time, I'm going with Pro XL model, because I want a bigger display this time around."
Same! My other 2 favorites are the 8 Plus and 15 Plus.
"I never had an iPhone but I've always wanted to have one as a secondary device just to play around with. My wife has the iPhone 13 and I have the Pixel 7. The only Apple devices I've ever owned were the original iPod touch and my current iPad 10th Gen which I only use for streaming videos, playing casual games, and the occasional Zoom calls."
"That's good to hear! Glad it's been great. All Google needs to do is focus more on the power and efficiency of their Tensor chips moving forward and they would be the best phones on the market in my humble opinion. I'm glad they are finally ditching Samsung and going with TSMC for the upcoming Tensor G5 chips. I'm hoping this brings improvement in efficiency, I'm honestly not expecting a huge boost in power though."
That's good to know! What do you have now?
Lol no I totally get it! I'm a smartphone nerd so I follow the entire industry. I have a preference of course but I acknowledge what each brand brings to the table. I try to be objective with their strengths and weaknesses.
That's a very fair point.
Thank you for sharing! This is always a fun conversation.
No problem! Thank you for sharing your thoughts!
Those are all fair points! My very last Samsung device was the Galaxy S6 but this was before the One UI days. Samsung has come a LOOOONG way since the TouchWiz era.
"To my knowledge only Huawei phones were officially banned here in the US, but as far as Oppo, Vivo, Honor, and Xiaomi, those companies just never sold phones here."
"I completely understand. Thank you for sharing your thoughts on this, my friend."
"I completely agree with you on this. My personal preference is Google because I like their software approach. I only wish they stepped it up a bit with their hardware. That being said, I never had a single issue with any of the two Pixel phones I've owned so far. My beloved Pixel 2XL was my first Google phone and the one that made me a fan. I had it for 5 years and it remained flawless performance wise the whole time I had it. I have had my Pixel 7 since launch and the same story. Still rocking along pretty well almost 3 years later. I like how the software remains stable, smooth, and well optimized for years."
Man that doesn't sound fun. I personally prefer Pixel phones due to the software. I just wish Google stepped it up a bit when it comes to their hardware.
I hear great things about them. I want them.
If the Pixel phones didn't exist OnePlus would be my first choice followed closely by the Samsung Galaxy S series phones. I like what OnePlus is doing with their hardware. Did you get your 7 Pro at launch? I really wanted to go with the 7 Pro when it was time for me to upgrade but I want with the regular 7 due to the 7 Pro having a curved display. I do plan to upgrade next year to the 11 Pro XL because I want a bigger display this time around.
That's totally understandable. I know NFC is definitely a must these days.
That's totally fair. Thank you for sharing your thoughts on this.
1520 was the best windows phone I ever had and then the 930 for its compact size. 
"Yeah, around when Android 12 builds were released is when I think they ""merged"" them. That's when OnePlus went down the drain. In my mind the 7 Pro was really the last phone that personified the original OnePlus vision- top tier hardware at a budget price with some nice customizations on Android."
"That's definitely legitimate. I'm a Pixel fanboy but I'm also an objective one. I know Google hasn't done the best with their hardware over the years, though it is getting better, they still have some ways to go. I personally haven't had any issues with either my beloved 2XL or my current 7 but I know many have, especially when it comes to the chipset and the modem. Google really needs to focus more on their hardware. I personally think their software is the best in the business it terms of fluidity and optimization, but their Tensor chips need to step it up with the power and efficiency. I'm glad Google is finally going with TSMC for their upcoming Tensor G5 chip along with a flagship MediaTek modem  for the Pixel 10 series. which really excites me as a Pixel fan. 

Again, I haven't had any issues with overheating on my Pixel 7 and performance has been great for me, but I know Google can definitely do better with their hardware, no question."
"Actually, since I drive a small car, a 2021 MX-5, I still get great fuel economy.

It wasn't about the soda, it was all about the drive. And getting away from my mother in law."
"Although it doesn't keep me from being stupid.

About a month ago, my R8 was going off and I even saw the cop. 54 in a 40 plus I forgot to put the insurance card back in the car. They let me go without a ticket because I have such a perfect record. Perfect, that was the 61st time I've been stopped for speeding but admittedly, that was mostly in my youth.

It even included what might have been insulting ""just take it easy, don't want to be showing the kids a bad example"". All my adult kids drive at it below the speed limit. Example, it took my adult kids 32 hours to drive from their old house to mine (they moved here to be nearer to me). Took me 10 hours less.

[950 miles ](https://youtu.be/oaZ0PekPE34?si=S5vtNepw2Wv3AwiS)
Example of the first segment but they drove 32 hours straight"
Your welcome 🙏
"It was a cool phone! It was like a BlackBerry Bold, but Windows based. I really liked it. It had 3G which was before the iPhone 3G came out if I’m not mistaken, but it absolutely ate its battery. But I remember it came with an extended battery in the box, and an extra back cover with a camel hump to fit that bigger battery. Good times."
"Glad it's been rocking along pretty well for you. I'm looking to upgrade either this year to the Pixel 10 Pro XL or wait until next year for the Pixel 11 series. The only reason is because of the hardware. I want to go with a larger display this time around. Plus I want a more efficient chipset and modem. I'm watching what Google does with the Pixel 10 series, I'm really curious to see how a TSMC made Tensor G5 chip along with the rumored MediaTek modem will perform for the Pixel 10 series."
Now it's where Google's AI literally answers the phone for you and asks what you're calling about and the phone will tell you what their response is and you can choose to keep asking them questions via the Google AI to find out more info or you can hang up or answer. Pretty much all spam calls. Just hang up when they hear it and it seems like I don't even get any anymore after a few years of having pixels. It's like they took me off the list because they know my shit's going to screen them
"If you do you won't regret it. They're some of the best out there, especially for the price. Even the non-pro and the basic Nord series ones are pretty decent."
"No, it's some of the hardware components too. The device I bought has some network issues and gps problems. Sometimes it doesn't get a signal. I once heard about this before I bought my phone, but I didn't quite understand it back then. Now I do. The processor alone isn't always enough, specially if you're out of signal in the middle of nowhere."
IMO The pixel is perfect if the battery was better.
"Honestly it's the Pixel of iOS. I keep it so people don't complain about Blue or green text, plus all my passwords and auto logins. However, I'm slowly moving everything to Android lately to move away from iOS."
"I am not really into the details of technologies but in terms of ux and design It's the best Android phone I've ever used in my life. Specially the size, very handy."
You’re welcome. Agreed.
"Not right at launch, but not too long after. I absolutely loved the screen on it. High refresh rate before that became a standard thing and no camera cutout. The popup camera was so cool.

Also, I'm apparently in the minority of actually liking the screen curve. Gives a nice tactile edge for the back gesture."
nokias had the absolute best cameras. can't remember the models i had but they were the verizon models.i still have a few of them in a box somewhere.
The extra battery and the battery hump reminds me of my old Motorola Droid Bionic. I miss the days when you got more in the box smh.
Wow.. that's pretty good. Thanks for the explanation
This is good to know!!
"Thank you for elaborating, my friend. Which phone model do you have?"
"Yeah, I'm a Pixel fan but I've always called them out for their hardware. Google really needs to continue to step it up with their Tensor chips in terms of power and efficiency. I'm glad they are finally switching to TSMC for the upcoming Tensor G5 chip. Also I hear there are rumors of them switching to MediaTek's flagship modem as well, but I'm not sure."
Thankfully RCS has solved a lot of the issues Apple created when it comes to messaging between iOS and Android. I respect Apple for their quality but I really don't like them as a company and how they do business.
"That's totally understandable. I'm a bit of a nerd when it comes to smartphones lol it's a hobby of mine. But I'm glad you're enjoying it, my friend 🙂"
"That's totally fair. I guess I've always been leery of curved displays due to durability concerns, but to be fair I never had a phone with a curved display so I admit I'm not qualified to speak on them."
"I miss when phones had the ability to swap batteries, and add storage expansion with SD cards. I remember having a dock that could charge an extra battery for my BlackBerry, so if your phone was dying you could just swap out with a fully charged battery ready to go and keep it moving instead of needing to stop and wait for the phone to charge."
[removed]
I am a nerd too friend but not specially smartphones but computers.
"Can't say I've ever had a problem, and I don't even use screen protectors."
Yes I'm with you on that. Hopefully so!
I appreciate what you do!
That's good to know! So now I'm kicking myself for not going with the 7 Pro 😑 lolol
I'm glad to see this much pixi dans here in the comments. I hope more people come across google phones they are not well known outside us. Here in my country I may be the first and the last user of my phone. There is not much demand for this phone here.
"I actually just pulled it back out the other day and flashed LineageOS on it to use it for random stuff around the house. So much better than the garbage OxygenOS 12 release. That's what pushed me back to the Pixel, but I forgot how much I liked that phone."
Yeah me too! I'm in the US and rarely see Pixels in the wild. It's increased slightly since the Pixel 6 series came out but the US is still dominated by Apple and Samsung. It's like most people have no clue about Pixel phones here which is frustrating.
I think google doesn't want it phones get used as much as it's other products cuz if it wanted he would... I think google knows their customers and knows how to keep them happy but doesn't want more of them. 😂
Haha 😂 I wouldn't put it past them 😂
