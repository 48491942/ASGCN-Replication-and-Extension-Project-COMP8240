"Less about brand an more about price point.  That being said longevity is going to primarily be determined by you, the user."
"generally, youll get what you paid for. i dont believe in brands... only the specific model.

just look for laptops in your price range, watch reviews and make decision. blindly trusting in brands and hating on others isnt gonna give you a reliable laptop"
"* ThinkPad T, X1 and P series laptops

* Dell Latitude and Precision laptops

* Apple’s MacBook Airs & Pros

I had all of these at various times and can confirm. "
Unfortunately it's either a Thinkpad or a Macbook
"Fujitsu, Eurocom, I've heard mixed things about Dynabook but maybe.

Used to be Lenovo, not anymore for sure. Dell makes cheap dogshit now, so does HP for the most part on the consumer part but if you can get a HP workstation laptop those tend to be pretty good.

There was some German brand, I think Tuxedo? They aren't really tested yet but from what I've seen they would be the type to focus on long-term life of their products."
"Corporate Dell Latitudes. They're made to last while being used on dusty work sites & made to be worked on by IT departments. If they weren't reliable & corporate IT crews didn't like them, they'd use something else. There are also always used parts available for them since corporations upgrade every few years."
Thinkpad
"Other than Apple, there are no brands that focus on that across their entire lineup. But most brands do have a sub-brand or several which are designed and built as daily use workhorses.

Lenovo's ThinkPads are one of those. I've had a lot of them and haven't experienced wifi issues with them. Dell has their Latitude series - or Pro with their new naming system (Pro Plus and Pro Premium are nice). HP has EliteBooks and ZBooks that fit the description. Asus has ExpertBook series. Acer has TravelMate series."
"Macs.

I don't like Apple and I don't use their products, but it is clear that their devices can last. In fact, from what I remember, device's degrading performance used to be done by apple through software updates, because their hardware is just super good. Assholes.

Lenovos as largely reliable. I ran a business with a fleet of 10 or so lenovos and one of them had issues and levono fixed it inmediately. 

HPs are absolute crap. They lost me as a customer years ago. 

In any case, much better to buy a 1-3 year old, highly specced laptop than a cheap new one. Everything below 500 Euros is e-waste at this point. Except for Chuwi. Solid machines for the ridiculous price. Again, you get what you pay for. 

I'm eyeing framework for my next purchase."
"Get a refurbished latitude, thinkpad or elitebook.

Business class laptops are made with better materials overall, and it is much easier to find spare parts like batteries or screens if something goes bad"
The best? Microsoft​ Surface Laptop and Apple MacBook have very similar look and feel. Both have very strong body and will be good for 5-10 years depending on your needs.
"Apple MacBook's, especially the pro models, but really all of them except the ones with the butterfly keyboard (2015-2019) are built like tanks and will last a really long time. That's what i would recommend. Do NOT buy budget computers, especially dell inspirions and whatever HP's equivalent is. They will have issue after issue."
I've sworn by Asus for the last 10 or so years and none of their products have ever let me down
The ASUS S line is top notch in build quality
"Ive got an Elitebook 645 that gets used 8 hours a day, been going a year so far and no hitches to report. The latest model equivalent would be the Elitebook 6 G1a 14""

Alternatively, today's Macbooks seem to just work with no real issues."
"The Surface RT, Lenovo Chromebook Duet, M5Stack Cardputer, Apple Vision Pro, Meta Quest 3, Chromebook Pixel, and even the iBook G4 are pretty reliable."
"Apple has to be right up there.  Solid hardware and they control the OS software. 

 Dell and HP enterprise versions (latitude and elite book.  And of course, thinkpads."
"Macs. They carry insane battery & power for about 60-70% of everyday tasks. Gaming is a question. You should look into how you can load it on your Mac. My M1 has gone 5 years & I just replaced it with an M4 Pro, giving the M1 to my brother & it is still amazing. 

HP's are, meh. Nothing too special about them from what I have seen. 

Corporate Dells are pretty good too. You can save some money on the laptop & get some good accessories for it."

"I've used Dell for years and not had a problem. 
The next one I'll be check8ng out Lenovo prior to purchase as well."
"I would reccomend something like a dell latitue 7000 series or the 5000 series  
there is also dell precesion 7510 series if you donot mind the weight, they are built like literal tanks and preform like that, a few of them even come with xeon processors, and with enough optimization you can squeeze from 6 to 8 hours of battery life from them"
"Latitude, Elitebook, ThinkPad. All good."
this isn't exactly the answer to your question but I think the real best solution is anything with a warranty that offers on-site support
The specific model is more important than the brand in terms of quality and longevity with the business models generally having the best builds. I have a 2014 HP ProBook which is still very fast and reliable. I only just recently replaced it with a new ProBook because I thought that I couldn't upgrade it to Win 11. The 2014 ProBook is running Win 10 which won't be supported by Microsoft after 10/2025. The weak point for most laptops are the screen hinges and the ProBook's appear to be strong.
"Depends on how lucky you are...

I have bought lots of them in the past, for the companies I've worked for, I have used Acer, Fujitsu-Siemens, HP, Dell, and Thinkpads.

A mix of brands at the beginning, Acer had a terrible after-sales department/service.

Fujitsu-Siemens was expensive for the options and not worth it... some of them came with dead batteries from the factory.

we started buying HP afterwards, most of them had electrical problems.

Then we switched to IBM and after that Lenovo, their thinkpads are still working fine, never have got any issue caused by the hardware.

Can't say about Dell, not enough experience with them.

Being in the industrial programming business, can't say anything about macs either.

Given my experience I'd say Thinkpads, but that can be completely different for someone else...

  
Lenovo is the first world seller (in units), they have great company options and great warranty options too (international upgrades with 24 hours replacement granted even for accidental damage), and their Vantage software keeps your drivers and propietary software up to date."
"My workplace stopped rolling out Dells and now uses Lenovo Thinkpads. I work for the help desk, and the Lenovos are better, but aren't what I use for myself. I would say my work laptop is fine for work, though."
"Toshiba was always my go to brand, but I believe they have been replaced by Dynabook which may or may not be as good.

Geez, I'm still rocking a Toshiba with Windows 7."
"I bought my MacBook 10 years ago, and it’s still running great. From what I’ve seen and read, they remain very reliable, so I’m planning to get a new one since I can’t update this one anymore."
ThinkPad
MacBook Air
"Asus or msi.
Actually all Lenovo uses low temperature soldering and need a reballing after 2-3 years.
HP is crap (only elitebook is fine), Dell is regular.
Dynabook only premium models with magnesium chasis.
Fujitsu is good.
The electronic technicians generally recommends msi or asus based in low rate of failure.
Msi fails the hinge but nothing more."
"Apple, Apple, and Apple."
"I like my Huawei Matebook now. Good build quality overall, battery not amazing but enough for me.

Using for 1.5 year"
"Not much a brand thing, but the line. The high-end business machines will last a decade. And they can be repaired - there is usually abundance of spares.

You can buy a 2yo Dell Lattitude for a price of 25% of a new one. It will still look and work like a new one..."
"MacBook generally have the best quality these days. As for windows, the consistency is not good no matter which brand you go. Personally I think dynabook is one of the best for smaller machines and HP Elitebook 10 series as the most reliable big brand. 

FYI, I am a semi reseller and IT fans. My company used all HP and no hassle at all as well as their support. We sold many dynabooks and only few had a battery issue. Far better than ThinkPad(Yep, we encountered DOA which is intolerable these days) Panasonic is also good but very limited coverage in the USA, maintenance would be a nightmare. 

What's more, you need to spend at least 1500USD for a decent laptop these days. And use only a bigger name parts. Like Kingston Fury RAM, Crucial RAM and some OEM part like SKHynix(they are the best for DDR5), Samsung 990Pro 4T(no 0E issue ever), SK Hynix P41. P31. They are tested and true parts. If you buy knockoffs like kingbok, you may have good chance for money as well as quality but you may get into trouble as their source is different than premium . Money holds it's value."
"Don't discount Lenovo for their higher lines. Have a Lenovo Legion Legion with 64 GB of ram and multiple hard drives for faster disk I/O which has lasted longer than a newer Asus tuf 17 gaming laptop that had a dead M.2 after just over a year old. Used a electronik max 17 that I used as a workstation that I kept on 24/7 so I could always log in remotely. All were over $2,000 new, used them for work as a DBA. The electronik max 17 finally had a dead monitor after 3 years which I could have fixed for around $100. Cool laptop, they gave it a covert gaming laptop name, didn't have any any stickers at all so I could use it for the board room without sticking out."
"Definitely not Asus, I have a ZenBook 18 months old and the keyboard started to have issues.  Prior to this I had a Surface Pro that I used for 6 years and it was still going strong, not one problem"
Apple M series Mac's are insanely reliable and longlasting
The only problems I've ever had with laptops is with the keyboards. They break and fall out and go missing.... This is why I like my Surface Pro. I can just buy a new keyboard and it's like new.
I've heard of great things from Framework. They're designed to be repaired and upgraded. I don't think there's many options better than that if Lenovo is not an interest.
"Brand doesn't matter.. specs, build quality matters.. 90% of reddit users are comparing 10 y. old 180€ plastic, 3kg heavy , 6 gb ram, intel celeron laptop to 2500€ macbook and they think, that the difference is in brand.."
"Dell Precision for me.
Avoid all those fancy thin laptops. No headroom for proper cooling and they will throttle like hell and get hot."
"My strange piece of advice is: find a local company for refurbished laptops, you will notice three or four same repeating series of three or four laptop brands, by this, you can find a new modern model at a ""normal"" shop... So as you already said Lenovo Thinkpad, but also I saw a lot of Dell (I don't remember what series) or HP ProBooks, also some Microsoft surface, which are light but they don't seem so durable for me"
"Really it’s not the brand, it’s the product line. For instance, and I’m generalizing, Dell Inspirons or vostros are complete consumer, plasticky junk. Dell xps, or latitudes are generally very solid."
"If reliability is what you are after MacBook is the only option I can think of. Their laptops can easily last over 5 years and still run fast. You won’t have any driver issue after numerous updates since Apple controls both hardware and software. Their M1 was released year 2020 and it’s still very fast and receiving update to date. 10+ hours of use is a breeze since MacOS is very stable. As of writing my uptime is 21 days already and no lag/slowdown at all.

For windows laptop I'd lean towards Asus. My laptop when I was in college was an i5 Asus with Nvidia. The build quality is really solid. It was tortured for years (falls while inside the bag from the armchair, squeezed in my bag together with some books and sometimes clothes, there was a time I accidentally sat on it on the couch) and it survived through college. After some time I noticed that there were like whitish parts kinda like when you apply pressure from the back of the monitor. Probably the screen's case got a bit deformed from the frequent pressure applied to it. I just ignored it since the screen for that model is not that good anyways. At that point I no longer need the portability part so I just hooked up a monitor.

I only started having major issues after around 4 years. Some keys on the keyboard were a bit hard to detect when pressed until eventually it stopped working. Keyboard can easily be replaced but since I use it like a PC at that point and have it hooked up with a monitor, wireless keyboard and mouse, I just left it be."
"hi if ever you could try the [asus vivobook](https://www.asus.com/ph/laptops/for-home/vivobook/) line, it worked very well for me , or other than that you can use apple the macbook air or pro."
"[Asus](https://www.asus.com/ph/content/ai-powered-everyday-with-ai-pcs-from-asus/). Their newer ones are AI powered that basically assists you in your work. Makes life easier cuz its future proofed for sure. Reliable, great battery, and mostly good specs."
"Nothing you’re considering now will come close to the MacBook Air M4 as far as machinery, battery, lifespan, fan/heating. Unfortunately, it only runs macOS, which can be very limiting depending on your country, job, etc. "
"I have a high-end Dell at work and it is doing great – except that on my previous model some buttons stopped working after 2.5 years… otherwise a great, heavy, bulky computer without any problems. In the course of the last 25 years I had Lenovos, Fujitsus and also an iMac. The screen of this latter went wrong after 2 years… With Lenovo I never had any problems, however, my colleagues had a lot.

So in short: as of 2025 I wouldn’t buy anything else than either a Microsoft Surface Pro tablet or a MacBook Air/Pro. Now I have the Surface Pro 11 and it is really great."
MSI
Asus if you can maintain it
I still use my MS Surface Laptop 2
"As others are pointing out it's really more down to the model than the brand. 

I work in IT(tech support) for a company that has around 100 laptops. Lenovo(Thinkpads), HP(Probook,Zbook series), Dell(Latitude and XPS and Precision series).

The least amount of work I have to do(hardware and software glitches) are 100% on Thinkpads but the Zbook line also seems to be decent from HP.

In general Lenovo Thinkpad series has been known for its reliability. Some say it changed and I can't comment on that at least not yet.

But if you are planning on using a laptop with a dock, then it's something like this.

1. Lenovo
2. Dell
3. HP(80% of dock related issues I need to fix are on HP laptops paired with HP docks. But 50% of the company is on HP so think of that what you will)

If I would have to grossly generalise, I would say Lenovo is the best out of the mainstream brands(but again, focus on the model or the very least the product line).

And if we'd go niche, I'd throw Framework and XMG/Schenker into the mix

If I'd have to buy a laptop today I'd look at XMG/Schenker. Or Framework if I'd have a bit more money"
"Best Reliable collection by me,

**🍎 Apple (MacBooks)**

* **Super reliable**, especially if you don’t mind macOS.
* Built like a tank, gets updates for years.
* Downside: expensive to buy *and* expensive to fix.
* But if you treat it well, it’ll probably last you 5–7 years easy.

**💼 Lenovo (ThinkPad line especially)**

* The **ThinkPad series** (like T or X series) is known for being solid and durable — like business tanks.
* Great keyboard, easy to repair, parts are available.
* Avoid the cheap IdeaPad models — they’re hit or miss.

**💻 Dell (XPS & Latitude series)**

* **XPS** is like Dell’s answer to the MacBook: sleek, strong, reliable.
* **Latitude** is their business line, also built to last.
* Cheaper Dell laptops (Inspiron, Vostro) can be OK but watch out for heating and build quality issues.

**📎 HP (EliteBook series is good)**

* HP’s business laptops = good stuff (EliteBook, ZBook).
* Their cheaper consumer laptops? Not as great — more likely to have issues.
* Check reviews before buying, and avoid the super budget models.

**🎮 ASUS (ZenBook, ROG, etc.)**

* ASUS makes **really solid mid-range and gaming laptops**.
* Good performance for the price, decent build."
"It really depends on your budget. Normally i recommend (to my clients) higher end Dell Latitude, HP Elitebook or Thinkpad. But I understand you don't want a Lenovo. Also, the Microsoft Surface Laptop from the business division is good quality.

If you want a lot of tabs open, then I would suggest 32GB of RAM.

Do you have a budget in mind? The Dell Pro 14 Premium is pretty nice. But expensive. You can also order it with an OLED screen if that's is important to you. I would also recommend Pro Support warranty or Pro Support with accidental Damage warranty. 

The less expensive laptops will be plastic. The more expensive ones will be aluminum or magnesium.

I'd be happy to assist you further if I know your budget and what size you're looking for."
"Dell, Lenovo (the expensive ones)"
Ive have 2 Dell XPS laptops and both have been solid.
Apple. Best in business.
Dell or HP for me.
Is HP a good brand?
HP and Dell commercial units with commercial warranty. Boring simple reliable and if any issues ever show its usually next business day on site warranty.
"rugged laptops,"
Asus ExpertBook
"what about a macbook air? 

additionally framework may be pricey but its durable and you can easily repair in the long run."
Lenovo. Never buy an HP
"The laptop's wifi is mostly based on the wifi chip, most laptops let you swap them out fairly easily...

Budget laptops come with budget wifi chips. You can buy a new one and swap it if you want, or take note of it before you buy a laptop.

Lenovo uses different wifi chips depending on the laptop, I've never bought their laptop or suggested it, but avoiding a company due to a bad experience with 1 networking chip on 1 laptop is a poor reason. They buy the same wifi chips that many other laptop companies do. There are only like 3 relevant companies that make those chips... Even the good wifi chip brands like Intel sometimes make bad chips that only show signs a few years later.

Also, the battery in all electronics will degrade by a large amount over the years. I honestly wouldn't expect any current gen battery to last 5+ years, I'm not sure how important that is to you. But if the battery isn't important then I'd get a pc anyways..."
"Apple.

Been using ever since 2007. Nothing has happened. Back in 2008 my mom spent 3000€ on some HP laptop and she used it lightly and always on the table. She was watching videos and surfing the web and doing office tasks and the motherboard fried out and HP Support helped her for free only once, meanwhile Apple replaced my MacBooks battery twice for free during in 2011 and 2012 even though the laptop was from 2007 and now there's nothing better than the M - series MacBooks."
"It's not possible to narrow down laptops according to their build-quality based only on laptop brand. They can only be narrowed down by more specific laptop series, by which you need to specify price range and laptop type (business, gaming, consumer or workstation).

For example, high-quality business laptop series are HP EliteBook, Lenovo ThinkPad T and Apple MacBook Pro."
"For cheap/affordable category unexpectedly i will actually recommend Acer. Unlike Asus/MSI, Acer is much low key and you don't see them in the news that often. However Acer has been stable for me since day 1, only laptop that died after 2 yrs is due to splashing water on it. The remainder acer laptops all survived until i change laptop due to windows 10 ending support (The longest last for 7 yrs and still working, only battery no longer working)."
"I've had good experiences with MSI laptops, recently said goodbye to one that had lasted me 11 years. If it's purely a wifi problem though it may be worth getting a USB WiFi 6 dongle for your current laptop - WiFi standards have changed over 5 years and usually laptop internal wifi isn't easily upgradeable."
"should be upvoted more, Dell, Lenovo, HP they all build trash and quite nice quality machines, it really depends which model and usually you get what you pay for"
[Business laptops](https://smbtech.au/features/best-business-laptop/) get torture tested to much much higher degrees than consumer models. That's also true across all main brands.
"Totally agree! Brands are brands, but at the end of the day it’s really about your budget, what you actually need, and the reviews on the specific model you’re eyeing."
"I have a HP z fury 17 inch, i9 with the NVIDIA gpu..  I love it.  Excellent machine but weighs a ton."
"In my experience, they're not reliable and our internal IT doesn't like them, but we can't move away because we have a contract. 


So, mileage may vary. "
"Worst cooling on the latitudes, also on latest gen. Always go for Precisions, much better cooling and overall build quality (keyboard is on another level compared to latitude)."
"I have been given at work a Dell Latitude with Windows (do they come with Linux ?), absolutely terrible combo.

Maybe I’m too used to MacBook standards, but it’s just terrible. Can’t handle small excel spreadsheets, cannot get out of sleep in less than 5 minutes to save its life, the Start Menu freezes (!!!), explorer.exe crashes (multiple times some days !!!).  
Even the battery life is terrible, screen on but without doing anything, its battery discharges faster than my MBP’s while working on it."
"Nope. I've had no less than five Thinkpads, I don't count them as reliable.

I remember Asus used to make pretty solid laptops. My daughter has an ROG and is happy."
"I agree with Framework! Also, as far as I'm aware, apple doesn't do the software degradation thing with Macs. I constantly see posts of people still using their 10+ year old macbook as a daily driver. It just stops receiving security updates after a while, but in cases like that, you can probably just download linux. "
Jobs was obsessed with quality - MacBook cases are a solid block of machined aluminum - no other manufacturer is going to do that-
I have a 2015 pro and it still works. Only the layer on LCD is peeling off.  Love keyboard.

"Suggesting 32GB of RAM for something that has ""a lot of tabs open"" sounds insane to me."
"Perhaps, but I've had more issues with my $4000 Dell workstation laptops than any personal budget/used/or premium consumer laptop I've had. 


So IMO its a crapshoot no matter where you shop. "
"Good laptops are mostly not the lightest, absolutely normal. More headroom for better cooling and overall better build quality."
"Depends on the CPU, I have an 5450 model with ultra 5. It lasts about 8 hours and can handle PUBG pretty ok."
"Unfortunately this is the downside of Windows devices vs Macs - Apple don't make cut-price shit models, Windows laptop makers do. The higher end is very equivalent with the Windows devices being more flexible in what software and games they can run, but the low end is shit vs nothing, and it gives Windows devices a hell of a bad name.

Going on Currys/PCWorld (I'm in the UK) the cheapest Windows laptop they sell has an Intel Celeron 4020 CPU (which was shit in 2019, let alone now), 4GB of RAM (*not* enough), and 64 GB of EMMC storage (essentially a soldered-in SD card). It's *only £149*, and they clearly skimped on *everything*. It's essentially brand new ewaste. Apple wouldn't be caught dead selling something so bad. I truly feel sorry for anyone tricked into buying one thinking it's a good deal.

However if you buy something *actually decent*, with an Intel Core / AMD Ryzen CPU, 16GB RAM, and an actual SSD for storage... you can have a decent experience for only £400. £500 if you want something really solid.

Likely the company you work for just skimped. If you can tell us the specs (you can get the CPU / RAM from task manager) we can probably prove it. Your laptop is likely one of ancient, a useless ultra-bargain model, or both."
just hope you never have a keyboard issue because the ROG laptops keyboards are held in with 71 screws.
My 11 year old Asus g750jz is still in use..
"In my experience it's opposite. Used to have Asus the cheaper one, it wasn't good. I have Thinkpad T480 and it works perfectly fine, I bought it refurbished. It's not the fastest machine of course, and doesn't run modern AAA games, but it's designed to do business work. I don't know how long it will last , but it's 6 years old and works fine."
"And that’s why MacBooks feel so high quality, it’s because there built to quality that no windows laptop is built to."
"I think you can fix that with some cleaning stuff made for screens and some working with a microfiber cloth, not sure though."
"I understand and appreciate your reply/comment. But 16GB is the bare minimum anyone should get these days on a ""windows"" computer.  And a lot of computers have soldered in RAM, so you can't add more later. So if you want to make sure you don't need additional RAM 3 or 5 years down the line then getting 32 GB from the start is the way to go IMO."
Interesting. What goes wrong with them typically?
"I’d love the problem to be that it’s a cheap ass computer, but even though it’s not on sale anymore, a Dell Latitude 7440 with a 13th gen i7-1365U and 16 gigs of RAM seems to have sold around 1500-2000$."
Oh yeah!!!! nice!!!
"See, when Thinkpads were made by IBM, they were tanks. Since Lenovo took over, I don't know maybe they changed the materials or something. On paper is still a Thinkpad, but it's like a colossus on feet of clay. I had so many instances of corners chipping off from pretty light pressure or impacts. The keyboard is kinda flimsy, and the entire frame cricks and cracks."
"Yup, read about that. It's not bothering me much and I will retire this machine soon."
"A month or so ago my windows install became corrupted and I was unable to launch any Microsoft programs, which appears to have been tied to some Windows update. This could've been our IT, Microsoft, or Dell.  
  
Before that I've had an issue plugging the Dell Latitude into a Dell dock where about once a month it would do something weird to the EC and the CPU would become hard-locked at 0.87 GHz until I open the laptop and disconnect/reconnect the battery. I had this happen on multiple laptops and multiple docks."
"Those definitely the specs? Because there was also a Dell **E**7440 that's ancient.

If those are, then it should be fine and it's just faulty and your IT dept should be replacing it."
"i have had that annoying cpu clock issue on an HP Pavilion and Lenovo X1 Carbon.

windows updates getting bugged can also happen to anyone and an inplace upgrade should fix it"
