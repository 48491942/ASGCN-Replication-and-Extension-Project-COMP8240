no wait walmart is worse
i'm gonna say walmart.
but particularly one in like alabama or florida.
all unbrandedfast fashion stores
the trailer park
goodwill usually has someunusual options.
"that being said, i'm also the sort of person to say ""that's hideous."
"i must have it."""
an online foot fetish forum
walmart or meijer.
even the clothes on the shelves barely match each other.
"on a slight tangent, there are shops selling ""second hand usa clothes"" in my country, and just from one trip to local market, i have seen so many second hand t-shirts that are clearly from the us."
"some of them have, let's say, questionable designs."
"to be fair, though, they are still better than, say, being thrown away in the landfill or ultrafast-produced fast fashion stuffs, i suppose."
i'd have to say forever 21.. have you seen the sayings on the backs of the shirts
hey meijers has some actual name brand stuff like columbia
depends on your budget and style but start shopping at uniqlo and banana republic on 40 sale instead for good value basics.
if you are taking cost in into account then uniqlo is probably the best bang for your buck.
"grab a pair of selvedge jeans, pima cotton t shirts, airism underwear and undershirts."
then whatever else you need.
until you are done losing weight i wouldn't spend too much on more expensive versions.
"after that i would look at the american heritage style brands, particularly from japan."
iron heart makes stuff in larger sizes but check the measurement charts carefully since they are a japanese brand and run a little small.
for sweatshirts you can't go wrong with wonderlooper but it comes at a premium.
"unbranded denim, bronson basicsmil-surp, spier mckay suits, ocbds, knits."
those brands are a start but more importantly fit is king.
"get a flat measuring tape and find your measurements, then measure clothes that fit you well, and compare them to size guides."
"also, looking at reviews will assist in dialing in sizing."
"if you really care about sustainability and cheap prices, used is the way to go."
lots of variety of color and styles online.
"for the price of a new uniqlo piece, you can get a used ralph lauren on ebay and keep something nice and high quality out of the landfill."
"american giant, flint and tinder, reigning champ"
"merz b schwanen, iron heart, dehen 1920, imogene willie i would also throw ralph lauren and sunspel in there with the caveat that i feel like they're a little bit overpriced, but they're also more mainstream brands and easier to find."
everlane and patagonia are my go-tos for exactly this reason both hit your sustainability checkbox and have inclusive sizing.
uniqlo's also surprisingly durable for the price point.
their airism tees have survived like 3 years of constant wear for me without stretching out weird.
just gotta say the quality difference when you upgrade from fast fashion is totally worth it
"my go-to is uniqlo, and banana republic 40 off."
the gap factory has great sales and i think the quality of gap clothing is very nice.
very simple clothing and well made.
"i might be a little biased since i used to work there, but national standards is a canadian brand that does lots of excellent high-quality mens basics."
"they have pretty good sales pretty frequently, too."
"buck mason, taylor stitch"
no one's done the obligatory care instructions disclaimer yet keep in mind no matter how much you splurge on clothing even the best quality garments will go downhill quickly if not cared for properly.
"avoid washing too frequently, or infrequently."
avoid washing on excessively long cycles or at high heat.
"generally a good idea to turn most things inside out, but it's especially important for denim."
"avoid the tumble dryer, always line dry, and out of direct sun if it's coloured."
"sunspel, merz b schwanen, really dope"
"uniqlo, suitsupply, for denim"
house of blanks makes higher quality basics but they are pricey.
asket also is pricey but comes with impactsustainability info
uniqlo does a nice job for undershirts and such.
"all my casual pants, shorts, and t shirts are patagonia, they do really well with quality."
"just want to add that i love asrv, pricey for sure but the quality is great"
would definitely check out uniqlo
"if just white works, this is the best t-shirt i have worn in a long time."
"main reason being, it feels significant and not filmsy, while being 100 cotton."
"tubular, does not have side seams, is an added plus."
i also like how seamlessly the neckband is attached to the body.
"site shows xl available, i wear l though."
i had written to ask if they have it in other colors and they replied that currently only white.
i wanted black and navy.
"sunspel, officine generale"
maybe i am basic but i like brooks brothers and j.crew.
"just like everywhere else, not everything is great"
but i like most of their stuff.
i look for sales.
i lift weights and have a belly so their xxlxl stuff works for me without looking odd.
another option that most guys don't consider is ebay.
"for a comparable cost maybe a bit more to something boxy, bulky and poorly made from the gap or hm, you can get yourself into high-end menswear like todd snyder or rl."
this includes your basics.
and they're almost exclusively sold by vintage stores with high user reviews.
"plus, it's ebay -"
so you can make them an offer and many times they'll jump on it.
i've donated years worth of generic crap in favour of a smaller wardrobe largely made up of ebay finds.
"my stuff fits better and looks better, and holy hell it's all built to last."
something to consider.
"bylt has solid products, buck mason, uniqlo still has some diamonds... also wink wink"
uniqlo and gu sister company of uniqlo
a little expensive
but i quite like basics from club monaco and todd snyder.
high quality clothes with a specific point of view.
ledbury is great too.
uniqlo has the best to offer in this segment high quality basics but at affordable prices.
uniqlo is great
definitely uniqlo or los angeles apparel.
"if you're feeling a bit more adventurous and would like a boxy fit, there are a lot of great small la shops for that look."
i created a free 100 style tips for men guide if anyone wants some quick tips to start dessing better
banana republic on 40 sale this is important to know everything at br goes on sale at 40 off all the time.
would include the gap as well.
solid basics and same parent company as banana republic
so it's also on sale constantly.
br quality sucks.
bro is asking about quality and talk recommending fast fashion mall brands
i love wonderlooper.
"prioritizing fit, i absolutely have to recommend against unbranded, unless you can try them on in person."
miserable return policy for the variety of offered items.
"if you don't fit into any of their cuts, you're stuck with 100 of store credit that you literally cannot use"
i love my asket overshirt but it's kinda overpriced imo.
buck mason too.
love american giant
"this list i 100 agree with everything said, are you my mom by any chance"
that's not the case anymore.
"a few years ago, br really tightened up their sales."
things dont go on sale as often.
the 40 friends and family sale is twice a year once in the spring and once in the fall.
i always hold out to stock up on chinos and other office clothes.
"same parent company but not made in the same places - gap fit and materials are garbage once you get used to br, and br is quite mid in terms of both."
maybe you're referring to the old br but in recent years br stepped up their game.
"not every piece is at the same level but most stuff i get from them is solid, better than most mall brands for sure."
"just skip br factory, their quality is considerably worse"
japan loves ameircana workwear and has a long history with denim.
there is an entire subculture over there dedicated to the 50s do-wopgreaser look.
they have a real passion for it that it is just super rare in actual americans.
yeah they have completely taken up the slack on creating what usa stopped creating.
thankfully they did or we'd only have a very very few making it
"if op is us based, amazon carries ubs."
"then, returns are not an issue."
"they have l-tall as a sizing option, which i love."
they have tall versions of all their sizes as well
half my wardrobe is br and there's been definitely more than two 40 sales last year.
in br canada there was a 40 off everything including sales except leather since black friday all the way until end of january.
"but yeah, still definitely less sales than years ago"
they're owned by the same company as the gap and old navy.
"they're slightly more upscale than those but it isn't good, it doesn't even match j crew who's been going downhill"
fine is the best possible description of br.
it's fast fashion with more expensive photo shoots.
"well, that's not the case in the us at all."
"like i said, i keep a close watch because i buy my work clothes there."
"they run extra off sale items more often, but big discounts on full priced items are rare and have been for a few years."
getting a 3060 laptop that has 6gb of vram
my rog zephyrus has had endless issues with the keyboard and gpu switching
but i have just dealt with it because of asus's notoriously terrible us warranty service - i half expect them to break it worse and then charge me to get sent back my still-broken laptop
got a system continually got a bsod for memory management.
mb replaced 4 times with their ultimate warranty.
hd and ram were replaced twice.
14 trouble shooting calls in the first 6 months.
sub finally recommended i stand my ground about a full replacement.
lenovo lost the first and second replacement.
after 8 months nightmare they gave me my money back.
"i bought an asus tuf f15 in august 2021, my first ever gaming laptop specs in flair it was working fine, then in early 2022, the wifi chip a mediatek one started giving out, resulting in my online classes and tuitions getting disrupted."
"although i fixed it with an external adapter, the bluetooth is in the same chip, so it goes off randomly too."
"then in 2024, with no physical damage whatsoever, the speaker membrane got damaged and it resulted in an awful crackling sound, which i got a temporary fix."
i also got it cleaned and repasted then.
"now, i doubt the gpu fan has some issues, since my games are performing really poorly and g-helper shows gpu fan rpm at 0, and also the temporary fix for my speakers is starting to fall apart."
"honestly this has ruined my experience with tuf, and my dad was pissed he spent so much on an abomination will i buy a gaming laptop again definitely will it be a tuf hell no"
weren't gaming laptops but i had a lenovo yoga when it first came out.
"i think the charge port or something broke, so i sent it in to get it fixed."
"not sure what happened but they sent me 2 different ones, so i ended up with 2."
a month or so passed and it died again.
"i had given one to my sibling, and i think theirs died too."
wouldn't charge or anything.
i still have it in storage.
asus service sucks
why it might be worth it
"it's small compared to a full desktop set up for example you live in a school dorm, your don't have a big room, you need to move often for example if you're a younger person and move in-between both parents house if they're split ...."
it's also a fun thing to have if you have the disposable income.
worst story asus customer support suck.
i had 3 burned pixel on my rog laptop a couple years ago and they said you need 5 minimum for warranty ...
asus customer support suck.
worst experience buying an omen transcend 14 without checking the tgp of the rtx 4060 in it.
they gimped it at 65 max including a 25 watt boost.
"in real game play, it would go over about 58 watts."
extremely poor performance for a 4060 laptop.
i returned to bestbuy within 2 weeks and got a legion slim 5 with the 4070.
couldn't be happier with the legion.
mobility - i am not lugging an atx supertower and 2 ultrawide monitors onto a airport when i can just lug a laptop and use in the air and airport for light games.
"i had an asus rog strix gl503 1050ti back in the day, it was overheating like crazy and under a year it started giving me bsod issues."
"thankfully after so much back and forth, i was able to get a full refund."
their service sucked.
got a zephruss 4090 2024 and the touch pad would stop working every couple turn onoff cycles.
got a replacement of an omen 5080 wich has a similar gpu and better cpu preformance.
"probably the battery lifethen again my fault for selecting one with a desktop cpu .. lol , and the whole thing just no display out of the blue , lucky was still within warranty period ..."
"generally expensive gaming laptops that had bad ui screen, speakers, keyboard, cheap materials andor bad battery life."
it seems super weird that manufacturers can get away with selling something that's a bad laptop just because they managed to cram a good cpu and gpu in there.
got a tuf for my father.
price was great because they put some cheap ass hard drive with tech from the 90's it was simply way to slow to even run windows.
it worked alright once i replaced that
but i didn't see him for a couple years after that and he already had a different laptop by then.
i guess the rest of it just didn't last.
"were bought acer nitro 5 2021 before, in the first day everything its fine except the keyboard quality is poor,but to next 2 month later is arised many trouble as overheated though i away clean the fan and another port, and then is performancebattery impairment though is just 1 year later since i bought and despite i doesn't ever use over the limit, moreover many trouble as slowly to connection with usb, sound problem,etc generally is endless trouble, and finally i already sell it since 1 year ago and come back with desktop when my work no need to move a lot anymore"
the screen of my g14 became black screen.
there is no way to revert it back after many attempts.
"so, it just became a halftop with a dead screen"
"why do you think gaming laptops are still worth it despite the costs and lack of upgrade abilities compared to desktops it only has worth to those who actually need the performance to be portable, and it's not possible to use an sff pc or use a work laptop and have a separate desktop at home."
"gaming laptops are pretty niche in that sense that while they will never be on par with a dedicated desktop for gaming, or on par with a non-gaming laptop for battery efficiency, they're still a whole lot more portable than a desktop setup and more powerful than a non-gaming laptop for graphical use."
"if your use case needs both portability and power, and would like have just one machine, then it makes it worth it for you."
"my asus g16 4090 lasted about 18 months but now barely functions due to constant 0x133 bugchecks which have persisted through a clean windows install, latest drivers, and bios update."
and of course the warranty is expired now so that 3k laptop barely lasted 18 months.
thanks asus s
i was all very pro desktop until my last one crapped out on me and everything was already out of date on it - even the case.
my previous work laptop was a gaming laptop we bought 10 years ago where the gpu recently crapped out on me.
we're still using it in the company though.
it's outlasted our server.
there was nothing we could upgrade on the server.
it would be the ship of theseus to do any upgrades.
my old home gaming laptop is 6 years old and i've only had to replace a noisy fan recently.
i've done ssd and memory upgrades along the way.
my new gaming laptop is bliss.
technically i didn't need to buy it
but i thought after 6 years i deserve an upgrade.
"also if you look carefully there's decent priced gaming laptops where you can do some easy upgrades to make them great deals, whereas even entry level towers have gotten pricey."
"f the laptop, it's like a device where you can't save him,it's feels like laptop want himself to damage even though we care them.on my laptop first thing damage is whole keyboard even though i didn't use that much always clean it and it have so many problems i just give up"
if you think your laptop 4070 or 4060 can give you playable fps on demanding games without dlss you are wrong even 4090 on laptop struggle to keep 60 fps on ultra in black myth
this is me right now from a 1650 with 4gb to a 3060 with gasp 2 more gb
what keyboard issues have you been having
what do you recommend as a gaming laptop
"damn im kinda experiencing the same thing rn, not a lenovo but the same bsod for memory management"
"windows key and tab key don't work about half the time, issue persists in bios and doesn't happen when i use an external keyboard"
so pretty sure it's hardware related.
"if you're curious about the gpu thing, i get crazy artifacting but only if i have the gpu mode set to automatically switch when i open a game."
if i tell the machine to only ever use the dgpu it doesn't happen.
less about brand an more about price point.
"that being said longevity is going to primarily be determined by you, the user."
"generally, youll get what you paid for."
i dont believe in brands...
only the specific model.
"just look for laptops in your price range, watch reviews and make decision."
blindly trusting in brands and hating on others isnt gonna give you a reliable laptop
"thinkpad t, x1 and p series laptops dell latitude and precision laptops apple's macbook airs pros i had all of these at various times and can confirm."
unfortunately it's either a thinkpad or a macbook
"fujitsu, eurocom, i've heard mixed things about dynabook"
"used to be lenovo, not anymore for sure."
"dell makes cheap dogshit now, so does hp for the most part on the consumer part but if you can get a hp workstation laptop those tend to be pretty good."
"there was some german brand, i think tuxedo they aren't really tested yet"
but from what i've seen they would be the type to focus on long-term life of their products.
corporate dell latitudes.
they're made to last while being used on dusty work sites made to be worked on by it departments.
"if they weren't reliable corporate it crews didn't like them, they'd use something else."
there are also always used parts available for them since corporations upgrade every few years.
"other than apple, there are no brands that focus on that across their entire lineup."
but most brands do have a sub-brand or several which are designed and built as daily use workhorses.
lenovo's thinkpads are one of those.
i've had a lot of them and haven't experienced wifi issues with them.
dell has their latitude series - or pro with their new naming system pro plus and pro premium are nice.
hp has elitebooks and zbooks that fit the description.
asus has expertbook series.
acer has travelmate series.
i don't like apple
"and i don't use their products, but it is clear that their devices can last."
"in fact, from what i remember, device's degrading performance used to be done by apple through software updates, because their hardware is just super good. assholes."
lenovos as largely reliable.
i ran a business with a fleet of 10 or so lenovos and one of them had issues and levono fixed it inmediately.
hps are absolute crap.
they lost me as a customer years ago.
"in any case, much better to buy a 1-3 year old, highly specced laptop than a cheap new one."
everything below 500 euros is e-waste at this point.
except for chuwi.
solid machines for the ridiculous price.
"again, you get what you pay for."
i'm eyeing framework for my next purchase.
"get a refurbished latitude, thinkpad or elitebook."
"business class laptops are made with better materials overall, and it is much easier to find spare parts like batteries or screens if something goes bad"
the best microsoft surface laptop and apple macbook have very similar look and feel.
both have very strong body and will be good for 5-10 years depending on your needs.
"apple macbook's, especially the pro models, but really all of them except the ones with the butterfly keyboard 2015-2019 are built like tanks and will last a really long time."
that's what i would recommend.
"do not buy budget computers, especially dell inspirions and whatever hp's equivalent is."
they will have issue after issue.
i've sworn by asus for the last 10 or so years and none of their products have ever let me down
the asus s line is top notch in build quality
"ive got an elitebook 645 that gets used 8 hours a day, been going a year so far and no hitches to report."
"the latest model equivalent would be the elitebook 6 g1a 14"" alternatively, today's macbooks seem to just work with no real issues."
"the surface rt, lenovo chromebook duet, m5stack cardputer, apple vision pro, meta quest 3, chromebook pixel, and even the ibook g4 are pretty reliable."
apple has to be right up there.
solid hardware and they control the os software.
dell and hp enterprise versions latitude and elite book.
"and of course, thinkpads."
they carry insane battery power for about 60-70 of everyday tasks.
gaming is a question.
you should look into how you can load it on your mac.
"my m1 has gone 5 years i just replaced it with an m4 pro, giving the m1 to my brother it is still amazing."
"hp's are, meh."
nothing too special about them from what i have seen.
corporate dells are pretty good too.
you can save some money on the laptop get some good accessories for it.
toyota camry le
i've used dell for years and not had a problem.
the next one i'll be check8ng out lenovo prior to purchase as well.
"i would reccomend something like a dell latitue 7000 series or the 5000 series there is also dell precesion 7510 series if you donot mind the weight, they are built like literal tanks and preform like that, a few of them even come with xeon processors, and with enough optimization you can squeeze from 6 to 8 hours of battery life from them"
"latitude, elitebook, thinkpad."
this isn't exactly the answer to your question but i think the real best solution is anything with a warranty that offers on-site support
the specific model is more important than the brand in terms of quality and longevity with the business models generally having the best builds.
i have a 2014 hp probook which is still very fast and reliable.
i only just recently replaced it with a new probook because i thought that i couldn't upgrade it to win 11.
the 2014 probook is running win 10 which won't be supported by microsoft after 102025.
the weak point for most laptops are the screen hinges and the probook's appear to be strong.
depends on how lucky you are...
"i have bought lots of them in the past, for the companies i've worked for, i have used acer, fujitsu-siemens, hp, dell, and thinkpads."
"a mix of brands at the beginning, acer had a terrible after-sales departmentservice."
fujitsu-siemens was expensive for the options and not worth it... some of them came with dead batteries from the factory.
"we started buying hp afterwards, most of them had electrical problems."
"then we switched to ibm and after that lenovo, their thinkpads are still working fine, never have got any issue caused by the hardware."
"can't say about dell, not enough experience with them."
"being in the industrial programming business, can't say anything about macs either."
"given my experience i'd say thinkpads, but that can be completely different for someone else..."
"lenovo is the first world seller in units, they have great company options and great warranty options too international upgrades with 24 hours replacement granted even for accidental damage, and their vantage software keeps your drivers and propietary software up to date."
my workplace stopped rolling out dells and now uses lenovo thinkpads.
"i work for the help desk, and the lenovos are better, but aren't what i use for myself."
"i would say my work laptop is fine for work, though."
"toshiba was always my go to brand, but i believe they have been replaced by dynabook which may or may not be as good."
"geez, i'm still rocking a toshiba with windows 7."
"i bought my macbook 10 years ago, and it's still running great."
"from what i've seen and read, they remain very reliable, so i'm planning to get a new one since i can't update this one anymore."
asus or msi.
actually all lenovo uses low temperature soldering and need a reballing after 2-3 years.
"hp is crap only elitebook is fine, dell is regular."
dynabook only premium models with magnesium chasis.
fujitsu is good.
the electronic technicians generally recommends msi or asus based in low rate of failure.
msi fails the hinge but nothing more.
"apple, apple, and apple."
i like my huawei matebook now.
"good build quality overall, battery not amazing but enough for me."
using for 1.5 year
"not much a brand thing, but the line."
the high-end business machines will last a decade.
and they can be repaired - there is usually abundance of spares.
you can buy a 2yo dell lattitude for a price of 25 of a new one.
it will still look and work like a new one...
macbook generally have the best quality these days.
"as for windows, the consistency is not good no matter which brand you go."
personally i think dynabook is one of the best for smaller machines and hp elitebook 10 series as the most reliable big brand.
"fyi, i am a semi reseller and it fans."
my company used all hp and no hassle at all as well as their support.
we sold many dynabooks and only few had a battery issue.
"far better than thinkpadyep, we encountered doa which is intolerable these days panasonic is also good but very limited coverage in the usa, maintenance would be a nightmare."
"what's more, you need to spend at least 1500usd for a decent laptop these days."
and use only a bigger name parts.
"like kingston fury ram, crucial ram and some oem part like skhynixthey are the best for ddr5, samsung 990pro 4tno 0e issue ever, sk hynix p41."
they are tested and true parts.
"if you buy knockoffs like kingbok, you may have good chance for money as well as quality"
but you may get into trouble as their source is different than premium .
money holds it's value.
don't discount lenovo for their higher lines.
have a lenovo legion legion with 64 gb of ram and multiple hard drives for faster disk io which has lasted longer than a newer asus tuf 17 gaming laptop that had a dead m.2 after just over a year old.
used a electronik max 17 that i used as a workstation that i kept on 247 so i could always log in remotely.
"all were over 2,000 new, used them for work as a dba."
the electronik max 17 finally had a dead monitor after 3 years which i could have fixed for around 100.
"cool laptop, they gave it a covert gaming laptop name, didn't have any any stickers at all so i could use it for the board room without sticking out."
"definitely not asus, i have a zenbook 18 months old and the keyboard started to have issues."
"prior to this i had a surface pro that i used for 6 years and it was still going strong, not one problem"
apple m series mac's are insanely reliable and longlasting
the only problems i've ever had with laptops is with the keyboards.
they break and fall out and go missing....
this is why i like my surface pro.
i can just buy a new keyboard and it's like new.
i've heard of great things from framework.
they're designed to be repaired and upgraded.
i don't think there's many options better than that if lenovo is not an interest.
"brand doesn't matter.. specs, build quality matters.. 90 of reddit users are comparing 10 y. old 180 plastic, 3kg heavy , 6 gb ram, intel celeron laptop to 2500 macbook and they think, that the difference is in brand.."
dell precision for me.
avoid all those fancy thin laptops.
no headroom for proper cooling and they will throttle like hell and get hot.
"my strange piece of advice is find a local company for refurbished laptops, you will notice three or four same repeating series of three or four laptop brands, by this, you can find a new modern model at a ""normal"" shop..."
"so as you already said lenovo thinkpad, but also i saw a lot of dell i don't remember what series or hp probooks, also some microsoft surface, which are light but they don't seem so durable for me"
"really it's not the brand, it's the product line."
"for instance, and i'm generalizing, dell inspirons or vostros are complete consumer, plasticky junk."
"dell xps, or latitudes are generally very solid."
if reliability is what you are after macbook is the only option i can think of.
their laptops can easily last over 5 years and still run fast.
you won't have any driver issue after numerous updates since apple controls both hardware and software.
their m1 was released year 2020 and it's still very fast and receiving update to date.
10 hours of use is a breeze since macos is very stable.
as of writing my uptime is 21 days already and no lagslowdown at all.
for windows laptop i'd lean towards asus.
my laptop when i was in college was an i5 asus with nvidia.
the build quality is really solid.
"it was tortured for years falls while inside the bag from the armchair, squeezed in my bag together with some books and sometimes clothes, there was a time i accidentally sat on it on the couch and it survived through college."
after some time i noticed that there were like whitish parts kinda like when you apply pressure from the back of the monitor.
probably the screen's case got a bit deformed from the frequent pressure applied to it.
i just ignored it since the screen for that model is not that good anyways.
at that point i no longer need the portability part
so i just hooked up a monitor.
i only started having major issues after around 4 years.
some keys on the keyboard were a bit hard to detect when pressed until eventually it stopped working.
"keyboard can easily be replaced but since i use it like a pc at that point and have it hooked up with a monitor, wireless keyboard and mouse, i just left it be."
"hi if ever you could try the asus vivobook line, it worked very well for me , or other than that you can use apple the macbook air or pro."
asus their newer ones are ai powered that basically assists you in your work.
makes life easier cuz its future proofed for sure.
"reliable, great battery, and mostly good specs."
"nothing you're considering now will come close to the macbook air m4 as far as machinery, battery, lifespan, fanheating."
"unfortunately, it only runs macos, which can be very limiting depending on your country, job, etc."
"i have a high-end dell at work and it is doing great except that on my previous model some buttons stopped working after 2.5 years otherwise a great, heavy, bulky computer without any problems."
"in the course of the last 25 years i had lenovos, fujitsus and also an imac."
"the screen of this latter went wrong after 2 years with lenovo i never had any problems, however, my colleagues had a lot."
so in short as of 2025 i wouldn't buy anything else than either a microsoft surface pro tablet or a macbook ai.
now i have the surface pro 11
and it is really great.
asus if you can maintain it
i still use my ms surface laptop 2
as others are pointing out it's really more down to the model than the brand.
i work in ittech support for a company that has around 100 laptops.
"lenovothinkpads, hpprobook,zbook series, delllatitude and xps and precision series."
the least amount of work i have to dohardware and software glitches are 100 on thinkpads but the zbook line also seems to be decent from hp. in general lenovo thinkpad series has been known for its reliability.
some say it changed and i can't comment on that at least not yet.
"but if you are planning on using a laptop with a dock, then it's something like this."
1. lenovo 2.
hp80 of dock related issues i need to fix are on hp laptops paired with hp docks.
"but 50 of the company is on hp so think of that what you will if i would have to grossly generalise, i would say lenovo is the best out of the mainstream brandsbut again, focus on the model or the very least the product line."
"and if we'd go niche, i'd throw framework and xmgschenker into the mix if i'd have to buy a laptop today i'd look at xmgschenker."
or framework if i'd have a bit more money
"best reliable collection by me, apple macbooks super reliable, especially if you don't mind macos."
"built like a tank, gets updates for years."
downside expensive to buy and expensive to fix.
"but if you treat it well, it'll probably last you 57 years easy."
lenovo thinkpad line especially the thinkpad series like t or x series is known for being solid and durable like business tanks.
"great keyboard, easy to repair, parts are available."
avoid the cheap ideapad models they're hit or miss.
"dell xps latitude series xps is like dell's answer to the macbook sleek, strong, reliable."
"latitude is their business line, also built to last."
"cheaper dell laptops inspiron, vostro can be ok but watch out for heating and build quality issues."
"hp elitebook series is good hp's business laptops good stuff elitebook, zbook."
their cheaper consumer laptops not as great more likely to have issues.
"check reviews before buying, and avoid the super budget models."
"asus zenbook, rog, etc. asus makes really solid mid-range and gaming laptops."
"good performance for the price, decent build."
it really depends on your budget.
"normally i recommend to my clients higher end dell latitude, hp elitebook or thinkpad."
but i understand you don't want a lenovo.
"also, the microsoft surface laptop from the business division is good quality."
"if you want a lot of tabs open, then i would suggest 32gb of ram."
do you have a budget in mind the dell pro 14 premium is pretty nice.
you can also order it with an oled screen if that's is important to you.
i would also recommend pro support warranty or pro support with accidental damage warranty.
the less expensive laptops will be plastic.
the more expensive ones will be aluminum or magnesium.
i'd be happy to assist you further if i know your budget and what size you're looking for.
"dell, lenovo the expensive ones"
ive have 2 dell xps laptops and both have been solid.
best in business.
dell or hp for me.
is hp a good brand
hp and dell commercial units with commercial warranty.
boring simple reliable and if any issues ever show its usually next business day on site warranty.
what about a macbook air additionally framework may be pricey but its durable and you can easily repair in the long run.
never buy an hp
"the laptop's wifi is mostly based on the wifi chip, most laptops let you swap them out fairly easily... budget laptops come with budget wifi chips."
"you can buy a new one and swap it if you want, or take note of it before you buy a laptop."
"lenovo uses different wifi chips depending on the laptop, i've never bought their laptop or suggested it, but avoiding a company due to a bad experience with 1 networking chip on 1 laptop is a poor reason."
they buy the same wifi chips that many other laptop companies do.
there are only like 3 relevant companies that make those chips... even the good wifi chip brands like intel sometimes make bad chips that only show signs a few years later.
"also, the battery in all electronics will degrade by a large amount over the years."
"i honestly wouldn't expect any current gen battery to last 5 years, i'm not sure how important that is to you."
but if the battery isn't important then i'd get a pc anyways...
been using ever since 2007.
nothing has happened.
back in 2008 my mom spent 3000 on some hp laptop and she used it lightly and always on the table.
"she was watching videos and surfing the web and doing office tasks and the motherboard fried out and hp support helped her for free only once, meanwhile apple replaced my macbooks battery twice for free during in 2011 and 2012 even though the laptop was from 2007 and now there's nothing better than the m - series macbooks."
it's not possible to narrow down laptops according to their build-quality based only on laptop brand.
"they can only be narrowed down by more specific laptop series, by which you need to specify price range and laptop type business, gaming, consumer or workstation."
"for example, high-quality business laptop series are hp elitebook, lenovo thinkpad t and apple macbook pro."
for cheapaffordable category unexpectedly i will actually recommend acer.
"unlike asusmsi, acer is much low key and you don't see them in the news that often."
"however acer has been stable for me since day 1, only laptop that died after 2 yrs is due to splashing water on it."
"the remainder acer laptops all survived until i change laptop due to windows 10 ending support the longest last for 7 yrs and still working, only battery no longer working."
"i've had good experiences with msi laptops, recently said goodbye to one that had lasted me 11 years."
if it's purely a wifi problem though it may be worth getting a usb wifi 6 dongle for your current laptop - wifi standards have changed over 5 years and usually laptop internal wifi isn't easily upgradeable.
"should be upvoted more, dell, lenovo, hp they all build trash and quite nice quality machines, it really depends which model and usually you get what you pay for"
business laptops get torture tested to much much higher degrees than consumer models.
that's also true across all main brands.
"totally agree brands are brands, but at the end of the day it's really about your budget, what you actually need, and the reviews on the specific model you're eyeing."
"i have a hp z fury 17 inch, i9 with the nvidia gpu.."
i love it.
excellent machine but weighs a ton.
"in my experience, they're not reliable and our internal it doesn't like them, but we can't move away because we have a contract."
"so, mileage may vary."
"worst cooling on the latitudes, also on latest gen. always go for precisions, much better cooling and overall build quality keyboard is on another level compared to latitude."
"i have been given at work a dell latitude with windows do they come with linux , absolutely terrible combo."
"maybe i'm too used to macbook standards, but it's just terrible."
"can't handle small excel spreadsheets, cannot get out of sleep in less than 5 minutes to save its life, the start menu freezes , explorer.exe crashes multiple times some days ."
"even the battery life is terrible, screen on but without doing anything, its battery discharges faster than my mbp's while working on it."
"i've had no less than five thinkpads, i don't count them as reliable."
i remember asus used to make pretty solid laptops.
my daughter has an rog and is happy.
"i agree with framework also, as far as i'm aware, apple doesn't do the software degradation thing with macs."
i constantly see posts of people still using their 10 year old macbook as a daily driver.
"it just stops receiving security updates after a while, but in cases like that, you can probably just download linux."
jobs was obsessed with quality - macbook cases are a solid block of machined aluminum - no other manufacturer is going to do that-
i have a 2015 pro and it still works.
only the layer on lcd is peeling off.
you might be able to use this
"suggesting 32gb of ram for something that has ""a lot of tabs open"" sounds insane to me."
"perhaps, but i've had more issues with my 4000 dell workstation laptops than any personal budgetusedor premium consumer laptop i've had."
so imo its a crapshoot no matter where you shop.
"good laptops are mostly not the lightest, absolutely normal."
more headroom for better cooling and overall better build quality.
"depends on the cpu, i have an 5450 model with ultra 5."
it lasts about 8 hours and can handle pubg pretty ok.
"unfortunately this is the downside of windows devices vs macs - apple don't make cut-price shit models, windows laptop makers do."
"the higher end is very equivalent with the windows devices being more flexible in what software and games they can run, but the low end is shit vs nothing, and it gives windows devices a hell of a bad name."
"going on curryspcworld i'm in the uk the cheapest windows laptop they sell has an intel celeron 4020 cpu which was shit in 2019, let alone now, 4gb of ram not enough, and 64 gb of emmc storage essentially a soldered-in sd card."
"it's only 149, and they clearly skimped on everything."
it's essentially brand new ewaste.
apple wouldn't be caught dead selling something so bad.
i truly feel sorry for anyone tricked into buying one thinking it's a good deal.
"however if you buy something actually decent, with an intel core amd ryzen cpu, 16gb ram, and an actual ssd for storage... you can have a decent experience for only 400."
500 if you want something really solid.
likely the company you work for just skimped.
if you can tell us the specs you can get the cpu ram from task manager we can probably prove it.
"your laptop is likely one of ancient, a useless ultra-bargain model, or both."
just hope you never have a keyboard issue because the rog laptops keyboards are held in with 71 screws.
my 11 year old asus g750jz is still in use..
in my experience it's opposite.
"used to have asus the cheaper one, it wasn't good."
"i have thinkpad t480 and it works perfectly fine, i bought it refurbished."
"it's not the fastest machine of course, and doesn't run modern aaa games, but it's designed to do business work."
"i don't know how long it will last , but it's 6 years old and works fine."
"and that's why macbooks feel so high quality, it's because there built to quality that no windows laptop is built to."
"i think you can fix that with some cleaning stuff made for screens and some working with a microfiber cloth, not sure though."
i understand and appreciate your replycomment.
"but 16gb is the bare minimum anyone should get these days on a ""windows"" computer."
"and a lot of computers have soldered in ram, so you can't add more later."
so if you want to make sure you don't need additional ram 3 or 5 years down the line then getting 32 gb from the start is the way to go imo.
what goes wrong with them typically
"i'd love the problem to be that it's a cheap ass computer, but even though it's not on sale anymore, a dell latitude 7440 with a 13th gen i7-1365u and 16 gigs of ram seems to have sold around 1500-2000."
oh yeah nice
"see, when thinkpads were made by ibm, they were tanks."
"since lenovo took over, i don't know maybe they changed the materials or something."
"on paper is still a thinkpad, but it's like a colossus on feet of clay."
i had so many instances of corners chipping off from pretty light pressure or impacts.
"the keyboard is kinda flimsy, and the entire frame cricks and cracks."
"yup, read about that."
it's not bothering me much
and i will retire this machine soon.
"a month or so ago my windows install became corrupted and i was unable to launch any microsoft programs, which appears to have been tied to some windows update."
"this could've been our it, microsoft, or dell."
before that i've had an issue plugging the dell latitude into a dell dock where about once a month it would do something weird to the ec and the cpu would become hard-locked at 0.87 ghz until i open the laptop and disconnectreconnect the battery.
i had this happen on multiple laptops and multiple docks.
those definitely the specs because there was also a dell e7440 that's ancient.
"if those are, then it should be fine and it's just faulty and your it dept should be replacing it."
i have had that annoying cpu clock issue on an hp pavilion and lenovo x1 carbon.
windows updates getting bugged can also happen to anyone and an inplace upgrade should fix it
el jannah post franchising.
doesn't slap like the glory days
the pr company or restaurant pays the tiktokkers to go.
free meal and maybe cash.
it's been pretty bad in sydney of late some pretty average places have done a good job getting some social amplification which definitely isn't warranted.
better off going to cheap and cheerful thai in newtown
that 360 restaurant at sydney tower.
the food was underwhelming and not worth anything close to the price.
don't tell aunty.
you can get way better indian food for less than half the price in harris park.
truffles on instant noodles do one.
any merivale joint.
edit except lorraine which no longer exists.
that cheesecake was s tier.
creating a consistent restaurant experience is really fucking hard - as borne out by the many conflicting comments below and in every other corner of internet food discourse.
stop watching dead shit influencers whose whole existence is predicated on overhyping and selling a highlight reel of their existence and go out and eat the - quite frankly - absurd variety of high quality cuisines that sydney has to offer and accept that sometimes you're going to get dud.
"eljanah, shit food and has gone down hill since they got sold."
"hong ha, not worth the massive line that when you can go elsewhere and not line up."
quay is the worst of the worst.
"spent 750 with no alcohol and everything was liquified or jellied, yuck."
the confit pig jowl is the jewel in the menu and chef's favourite
and i can't express how gross it is.
some food is so amazing it makes you cry aka ormeggio at the spit.
we cried at quay too when the bill came.
"this reddit will eventually have one negative comment for every decent venue in the city, where will we all go lol"
"this thread is such a litany of sorrow - makes me almost glad that i'm too dead tired all the time looking after a newborn, to go out for a nice meal."
"rockpool bar and grill - it was just really quite average and the worst thing for me is that the worst dishes were the steak the best was the hiramasa kingfish but frankly, there's about 35,678 restaurants in sydney which have the same dish on their menu executed to the same quality."
ordered a cape grim rib eye on the bone rare to medium rare.
got this 1cm thick cooked to medium chunk of sadness.
"honourable mentions margaret, mjolner, peterman"
one more..controversial but have to say it.
you can shove your blame canada up your arse.
it's like eating sugar.
pellegrino 2000 was extremely average didn't think bentley was worth the price aria is very average
saint peter - josh niland has cultivated an amazing media presence championing the nose to tail approach
but i swear every time i've been there it just feels like regular well cooked seafood rather than anything fancy with weird parts of the fish bennelong - you're just paying for the view.
food is just nice produce cooked well but boring and uninspiring
we have friends that love the paddington and it's super popular but it's pretty underwhelming esp for what you're paying.
their rotisserie chicken is not worth the hype.
i've had a few good things there but happy to never go there again.
omg i said pellegrino a few weeks ago and everyone downvoted me.
it was a major letdown.
"any ""fine dining"" or ""trendy"" place in the shire cronulla etc the people around here have no clue what good food is."
just linen pants and lip fillers and style over substance in all these trendy places.
have been to every fancy restaurants locals recommend as amazing and they are absolutely below average.
stick to the city and inner city eastern suburbs for fine dining is what i've learned.
one of the sydney food insta people was actually unironically hyping up ikea food.
"the food is delicious, but they hussle you through."
"when you're paying all that money, you want to sit and enjoy it."
i found catalina to be disappointing and overrated.
service was particularly shit.
totally agree with pellegrino 2000.
small serving sizes and large prices.
"tasty, but not worth that price."
google reviews can back up my claim.
the italian bowl in newtown.
"no idea how it got so popular, it's extremely mid"
the italian bowl in newtown is proper mediocre
you guys can afford to eat out
"honestly, not sure how they're surviving."
absolutely terrible food.
just....meh in general.
"palazzo salata, which is one of the hyped restaurants in the cbd, was super underwhelming but it's always more annoying when they're 90 of the way there instead of being a straight ripoff."
"the wines were great, entrees were phenomenal, and then the pastas and steak we were on a set menu with a larger group were really average anything by the bentley group bentley, monopole, yellow, king clarence is pretty underwhelming for the price too."
"also, to offer some positive opinion i think icebergs continually lives up to the hype and deserves all the prizes it gets and the right to charge big prices."
"also, for a mid price lunch that's genuinely good, check out kitchen by mike in the city."
30 for a lunch
but it's worth the extra money compared to 23 for a bowl of wagieslop in a food court
passegiata in charing cross randwick absolutely abysmal food with 3 hat prices..avoid like.the plague that has caught corona and sars
i can overlook mistakes in the kitchen if the customer service is good enough to recover the evening.
"they badly fucked up my main duck was overcooked, quite tough instead of redoing it, the solution offered was to have the meat cooked further lmao."
had to pay full price too.
"i feel any chains which isn't fast food such as pacific concepts, rashrays and whatever groups tends to go really downhill once a restaurant join these groups and icing on the cake is jacked up prices i tend to study to see if a restaurant have a second branch or whatnot and if is does, i will try and pick the original one."
"sans fast food, any restaurants group or with 2 or more branches seems to be pretty inconsistent."
"i'd say frangos, i had it once and had pretty high expectations coz of all the hype."
"and they forgot an item, the chicken burger i had was ok but was fairly average."
also haven't tried el jannahs but am thinking will have the same experience.
still willing to give it another shot maybe.
not over hyped or over rated
but damn i miss est.
cant believe they closed the place down
", we went to the one in canley"
and they had very obviously put precooked chicken in our green curry.
it came to our table with chicken piece very obviously placed on top of the curry last minute.
"other than that, terrible service and inflated pricing with no improvement to back it up."
saddens me because it used to be a favourite of mine.
epicurean buffet at the crown barangaroo. feels like i am eating 50-60 buffets at a 100 setting.
"also we went for my dad's birthday on a sunday evening for 135pp....these sneaky bastards charged a ""sunday surcharge"", which makes it basically 150pp."
also they charged a credit card fee.....what year are we living in now do they want my to pay in cheque cash the bill for our table of 11 was more then 1600.
i would love to pay them with silver coins.
have to seriously rate the malaysian chinese kitchen bottom of salesforce tower.
best laksa in syd-e-ney
food was okay but service was absolute rubbish.
"felt rushed, backpacker severs couldn't understand clearly enunciated english and we had to ask for the same thing multiple times."
the opera house meringue dessert was crap
don't tell aunty
clare smyth - oncore.
i usually find reason to slip in something negative about this restaurant all the time but sorry the 750 spent was the only thing i can remember.
bourke street bakery. rubbish.
"nice vibe but the food is overpriced, tiny and average."
quay - everything just tasted salty
lots of people i know compared aria to vue de monde in melbourne.
"it was okay, but i felt a good 60 was riding on the coattails of the view."
wouldn't go back
went to matt moran's restaurant at the art gallery nsw last week and regret it.
very ordinary food.
"the beef tartare was inedible, way too thick and smothered in sour cream to disguise the taste."
th fish was dry and tasteless... supposed to be catch of the day but def.
the only good thing was the sauce on the crumbed scallops.
"dessert was fine, but its not hard to make creamy sugary things delicious."
and tthey were playing pop music... walked in to abba at the art galler i don't underestimate abba
but it was just in a mix of easy listening pop hits.
it seemed really out of place.
the staff were sweet.
"we gave our server a big tip for having to serve such shitty food and keeping graceful about it, lol."
overall a waste of a lot of money.
would not recommend.
went for my bday last week.
temasek was not for me at all.
"very quick service, but the hainanese chicken and nasi lemak both just had very little to them when i went."
any place that sells ramen 30 dollars a bowl out of a sterile concrete room
"for the price of the food, it wasn't out of this world."
don't get me wrong the food was good but you're paying 400 per person.
the steak was over 200 and wasn't the best steak i've had.
you also had to book several months in advance.
gelato messina and anita.
tetsuya in cbd
bastardo and portegno both were just meh after being hyped to us by numerous friends
stop using tiktok and instagram.
chiswick in woollahra.
"it's so busy you can't hear anything, and the times i've been there they have either messed up our order, run out of their signature dish or a collection of other stuff ups"
fat noodle at the star.
"the menu looks good on paper and i want to like the food, but everytime i gave them the chance it was always just bad tasting food."
it disgusts me how its always packed.
"food perhaps a bit better than average, service was poor and they rushed us."
for around 200 a head for a special occasion it wasn't worth it at all.
went to nagano in japan last month and for 50 a head went to this place for a meticulously prepared 8 course meal that was better in every way.
best dollar for dollar meal i've had anywhere.
clem's chicken in newtown.
"it is genuinely one of the worst chicken joints i've ever been to, yet because it's on king st in newtown, it's worshipped"
"it's not around anymore, but est was a very average experience for me."
cucinetta took my mum there for mother's day and we were both underwhelmed by the food especially given how expensive it was.
service and location were lovely though.
aria terrible terrible service
"dear sainte loise, could've been a bad day though."
otto the service was lovely but the food was quite unremarkable for the price.
i guess you're paying for the location but frankly sitting on pier looking at moored yachts is a bit underwhelming as well.
most of them
oatley chinese and malaysian
misc in parramatta
theeca in darlinghurst.
it's the epitome of what's wrong with sydney restaurants
"after hearing such great things about this restaurant, i was really looking forward to trying it."
i was so disappointed by the average dim sum dishes at marked up prices.
the char siu toothfish was quite unique and perfectly cooked but that's about it.
oribu... hands down the worst dining experience i had in sydney
hello auntie- vietnamese more upmarket place.
i dont find their food better than the cheaper places next to it.
maybe their produce is better quality but otherwise not that impressed
pellegrino is the most overrated that i've experienced.
but sydney is home to the over hyped restaurant scene.
it has a serious case if the emperor's new clothes syndrome
not terrible but not amazing for the price.
and they brought out all our dishes at once which i really hate.
huberts is much better imo.
epicurean actually sucks.
"as far as dining experiences go, the food was so mediocre, seafood so not-thawed-properly, i'd rather buy a piece of a5 and some fresh seafood for the money."
the crowd is also pretty questionable.
"one table had a skinny guy looking like he came straight off a traffic control shift talking to his cousins at such a fast pace, i honestly thought he had one too many cokes."
outrageously and egregiously paid over 400 for two of us to eat at restaurant hubert.
and my duck was underdone and sloppy.
anything in marrickville as of 4 years ago except corinthian
all of them
seriously i cant believe that they have a full dj playing club music while we are trying to eat out sushi.
like what japanese restaurant is like that
"your talking about nobu sydney, been 3 times invited by a client."
its bog average food.
we had 3 tacos for something like 30 the taco was dry and chewy.
doritos fresh from a bag is much better or those coles mexican tacos.
i told 2 servers one being a senior saying they cooked it wrong or it wasnt right
but they refused to listen and just said thats the way they made it.
they didnt even b bother to say they would go back to taste a sample from the kitchen.
any other restaurant would have taken it away and served a fresh meal.
"nobu perth and melbs is off the hook, cant recommend them enough."
"sydney is so crap, i actually will give them a 1 star google review once i get around to it"
plus it's a fancy chain.
amare in crown also gets my vote for terrible place to eat.
"agree the chicken has seen better days, when it wasn't a dehydrated, overburned twig."
used to be super cheap with a sizeable chunk.
i'd still eat the garlic sauce like it was a tub of yogurt though that shit is still amazing
earlwood el jannah stays winning
we've found inconsistency in the melbourne branches.
on the odd occasion the chicken is delicious and lemony perfection inside and out - next four times it's just well-above average charcoal chicken.
ehhh opposite imo.
use to be inconsistent back in the day.
now it's consistently decent as it's all done by particular standards and the dips are all made the same way and sealed.
it was.. better
the burwood one slaps
"yeah, el jannah fandom is a good indicator of people not to get food advice from."
had a disgusting chicken wrap at the bankstown store drive through.
won't go back
oh i was wondering if that would be the case...how sad...
"the dip sucks now, mass produced shit mixed with shit mayo"
"soooo dry, i think the blacktown one was the worst one i ever went to"
i agree that the chicken is dry too
"if youre talking about granville, i find hawa down the road to be so much better than el jannah."
i wholeheartedly recommend frango as an alternative
i got blocked by places in sydney for saying he's just a sellout and he never has any bad reviews bc they all give him incentives
this is pretty standard for all restaurants - they use social media influencers to promote their business and give them a free meal and cash if the account is big enough.
i feel like ito is a victim of this.
"went as a normal person, it was okay meh kinda bad."
my friend and i walked away speechless and don't talk about that meal anymore
"yes i had been starting to suspect this, just has happened like 3x in a row, rave reviews and great content on social media and then meh or worse irl"
anywhere that's on placesinsydney and their group friends i simply just don't go
theeca surry hills is a place i have never heard of anyone going but is all over tiktok.
feels a bit disingenuous.
you are dead right about the sameness of menu these days michelin guides visit your cityregioncountry if your tourism board pays michelin a fee.
that's why we are left out.
which is probably a good thing with all the same menus
"sydney is simply too expensive to take large risks with a menu so you end up seeing the same thing again and again, of course if you venture out to the shadowy lands of the poorly written english menus you can find some great stuff there."
"the dining scene in sydney is still far too immature, before social media made the world smaller we were a backwater, great ingredients but meh dining culture."
"in fact dining scene in sydney is mostly all based on views and hype, there's very few institutions that's got loyal returning diners."
chin chin for me too.
"food is relatively expensive and not particularly innovative, seating too close together and really noisy."
the food is good but no way did it live up to expectations.
"i knew the style of food they serve, so not expecting genuine thai, i just think it's overrated."
i had chin chin in melbourne prior to covid
"and it was pretty great late lunch, got great personal attention from the shift manager - tried sydneys one not long ago and the service was terrible eg a waitress spilt half a cocktail all over a friends shirt and just said ""oops sorry"" and walked away - we had to chase down the manager ourselves music was too loud - food was decent at least"
just go to the other side to haymarket thai town and you'll be spoilt for choice.
"heck just walk less than a block and go to spice i am, better thai food and less pretentious."
"yep, was boring when i ate."
another kingfish sashimi errr
"awful atmosphere, food only tastes half decent because it's loaded with sugar, fat, salt and the wait staff don't have a single clue."
chin chin was soooo average and upsettingly expensive for mid thai
totally awful - fast food slap dash with blaring music.
i live around the corner and used to pop in for just a drink but won't even don that now.
"probably because it's not a thai restaurant, it's pan south east asian"
i fucking love chin chin
"average food, super rude treatment by staff."
at least that was my experience a few years ago.
never went again.
i haven't been since all the renos they did a few years back.
"i liked it previously when you could just go up for a few drinks, haven't been since it's became a restaurant."
"agree, i'd give this place a miss"
i agree is this the o bar and dining they also automatically charge a ridiculous tipsurcharge
i recently went to chatkazz for the first time and and absolutely loved it.
food was delicious and there was an almost overwhelming amount of choice but everything we ordered was done very well.
service was attentive and helpful.
"was waiting to see this, holy shit is it overrated."
i thought the local indian takeaway was better
a great option for more elevated indian food is abhi's in concord.
"it's hatted i think, and deservingly."
"i think you go here for the fun atmosphere, with passable food."
"yep, most cbd indian is average at best."
people don't know what they're missing out on
"the town hall shop is the prime offender here and amah, haymarket has some specials that are a bit silly but at least leaves the option not to order stupid things like crab on ckt."
"but yeah, the unnecessary and forced up marketing of what was very good versions of street food is more than a little annoying."
way too expensive even for basic dishes
they used to be good..
but about a year ago or was it 2 it changed.
price hiked up... quality went down.
have not been back since.
"at the townhall shop they put unnecessary ingredients that don't add anything to their dishes but more the strathfield and haymarked stores are a bit better, but since about a year or so ago they hiked up their prices and it's not really worth it anymore."
i still think their laksa is really good though.
my more affordable haunts for laksa are malay chinese at salesforce towe or hokkien gia in campsie.
"ho jiak is pretty good, but not worth the price really"
i went there once.
all salty no taste.
truffles on pasta is a thing..
the newport is the perfect place to take new to sydney people and the food is pretty damn good.
i think i'm a basic bitch cause i love totti's
"i think totti's is overrated, but if the head chef is dan hong the food is always going to be good"
"while i understand the hate towards justin hemmes, i've had a lot of good experiences at merivale restaurants."
"i would recommend jimmy's falafel, felix and queen chow enmore."
"i feel like it's become trendy to hate companies like that, but vic on the park and jimmy's falafel are both great"
mimi's is amazing
lorraine's strawberry mascaporne cake was so gooodd omg
i miss lorraine's mascarpone cake
i won't take any jimmy's falafel slander
there was a thread here a few weeks ago where everyone was talking about how good merivale is glad that taste and sense have prevailed.
"agreed, but i thought mumu's is great."
"i am vietnamese and usually hate white-washed, fusion asian food but mumu's flavours texture was fantastic minus the price obviously"
swings and roundabouts.
merivale own local pubs like allawah hotel and they have hands down the cheapest and highest quality pub food in the entire st george
we used to buy cakes from lorraine for co workers when we worked nearby the good old days
jimmy's falafel is hero
mimis is yummy
people love to hate a merivale venue for no apparent reason besides who owns it.
this is hilariously accurate
that cheesecake was the best cake in sydney
insanely expensive and underwhelming for the price.
agreed food was ok but not worth the price
this place is very hit and miss.
"first time i went i loved it, next time was meh"
hate this place.
we rocked up at 528pm for a 530pm and the front of house made us wait
this should be top comment.
owner is a massive gronk too.
especially when there are multiple better ones just a few doors down.
worked in the area for years and i actually preferred the others that are further down botany road.
as a banh mi fiend i thought hong ha was actually very good but overwhelmingly raw onion tasting.
i struggle to find a better overall roll than the marrickville mpr.
but you are spoiled for choice in sydney and waiting in a queue for hong ha is a mistake.
i know i wasn't expecting such an outpouring -
"but i think, as someone else has commented in this thread - consistency is really hard, so some of these places might be great and just having an off night when the commenters went."
also not every place is going to appeal to every person - as shown by the many conflicting comments in this thread.
"so there is always hope and even if there are some places that are just consistently badoverhyped, there are sooo many in sydney that are amazing and meetexceed the hype we really are spoiled."
restaurants have always been an overrated thing.
they don't genuinely bring people that much joy even when they're great.
i used to love rockpool.
one of our vendors took us there for lunch a few months back.
ordered a 90 scotch fillet that was so chewy i threw half the steak out.
if i was paying i would have sent back the steak.
"after that experience i'll never eat steak out again, especially when i can reverse sear 100 times better than most restaurants on my kamado joe."
ugh mjolner had forgotten about that one hahaha
melbourne one is pretty shit too
chunk of sadness hahaha
feel like the burger hype has died down massively in the last 6 or 7 years.
"those ""premium"" burger places used to be all the rage but seems like they have much less presence now in terms of social media and stuff."
their cheese burger is the bomb tho
it has maple glazed bacon and maple aioli.
what did you expect
i am yet to find a better overall burger than bar luca and certainly nothing that has given me that wide open mouthed wow that my first blame canada gave me.
but i agree that it's a sugar bomb and is more of a short term rather than long term thing.
anything solotel and matt moran is underwhelming
aria sucks hard.
went there via a generous voucher.
had the worst meal and service i can remember.
their sommelier had no clue about their wines and was wearing a plastic watch.
can't believe people will pay 250 and above for that...
who is rating rashays highly
my brother was a kitchen hand for a week and left.
majority of their food is freezer food and fried foods that didn't go out were just re-fried and given to the next customer that orders.
"it was one of their most expensive dishes too, like a seafood platter."
it was all just frozen stuff anyone can buy.
"so yes, overpriced frozen food."
"every time i see a rashays it's empty, so i guess that stacks up."
"100 totally underwhelming, especially for the price."
"i agree with saint peter but disagree with bennelong i've always enjoyed the food, love the view, and love when they have live music eg their jazz sundays for me the three combined make the whole experience worth the cost."
"ooooh, that's a difficult one."
"i had one of his takeaway burgers in lockdown and it insanely good, and i don't even like burgers"
bennelong is superb although the service is bang average for the price.
"for saint peter initially i was like wtf are you taking about but realised i have never been there for dinner, which the menu sounds exactly as you describe."
"their lunch menu is super interesting though, and i really do feel it makes you rethink what you can do with seafood in a fun and tasty way."
i've been there twice for dinner and both experiences were 100 value for money.
"the fish ""wellington"" was absolutely amazing."
the service was great.
the venue is a little jewel box that has a buzz because its full.
his fish butchery is fantastic as well.
those 'cheeseburgers' rock.
"with the caveat that i haven't been for a couple of years, hard disagree on st peter - the swordfish steak and tuna n'duja are both still among my top 10 seafood dishes unless they've gone downhill or people are ordering a snapper fillet and expecting something transformative, i can't understand the hating"
it's probably a bit over hyped from netflix but personally we had an amazing experience there.
"yeah, it has really jumped the shark."
"spent 600 for two, a relatively uninspiring meal served by wait staff that just seemed a bit ""off"", terribly mistiming the dishes and matching wines."
100. 185 to access what you've actually come for the steak is just taking the piss.
"also, the lighting is way too bright to the point that it's off putting."
i assume they do that for the chefs benefit but bloody hell
we waited forever to get in
and then i was so disappointed.
nice enough food but nothing memorable.
"we also found the service super rushed, and we're not slow eaters"
bobby's just cropped up there it's pretty good
i'd hype daim pie
i've been here 5-6 times and i haven't really felt that.
we really enjoy our time
and i think it's one of the best restaurants in sydney.
service is impeccable and the food is always amazing.
"ahh this has been on my list - good to know, seems to be mentioned a couple of times in here."
was there about 6 months ago with a table of 15 - didn't feel rushed but there was not another seating after us and was delighted we could order al a carte have had way too many disappointing set menus due to large group size over the years
didn't get that vibe at all.
the meal and experience was wonderful.
i was looking for this comment.
this has to be my 1 over-rated restaurant in sydney.
"its full, expensive, noisy as hell which is crazy cos a lot of old folks are there and every time i go my in laws love it"
i always think the food is fine
but it isn't really worth it.
yeah catalina is for rich rose bay grandmothers who can't taste anything through their denture toothpaste.
it was great last time i went there in 2003
"i've been twice, and food is always great, as for prices point, it's not as expensive as most fine dining 3 course 150 is pretty good these days"
glad it wasn't just me was feeling a bit like the odd one out with all the rave reviews.
"when we went everything was under-seasoned, and the pasta was undercooked i prefer al dente, but this was crunchy to the point of being near inedible the bar staff and foh were great though to their credit - and the yuzu sgroppino was yummm"
it's the drizzling shits.
lotus at barangaroo is great and i'm chinese
i thought lotus at barangaroo was excellent when i ate there a few years back.
love sokyo too but it's pricey.
sokyo used to be excellent but haven't been since they had a shake up with the chefs years ago
"agreed, kitchen by mike is my go to work lunch venue for anyone with dietary requests."
"the food is tasty, fresh and the salads are actually exciting."
kitchen by mike is everything wrong with the sydney food scene.
"it's not bad food in if itself, but the idea of charging what they charge for pre-prepared canteen style food."
i had the same experience.
the pasta and steak was meh.
trying to be something it's not
yeah went here recently with family.
it's been my in-laws favourite restaurant for over 20 years.
they dine here at least 1-2 times a year.
they were so disappointed by the food and service the last time we went.
i believe it's had new ownersmanagement.
the new decor was nice but nothing special.
service was ok but not great.
a few mistakes and timing errors which could have been forgiven if the food was better.
entrees and dessert were fabulous but mains were pretty average or one dimensional.
"went there for the first time a few months ago and they gave us an awful table, service was just strange one of our waiters seemed extremely off putting , and very overpriced drinks."
was excited to go beforehand
so i felt quite sad after
"save yourself the money, don't buy into the ej hype."
i tried it because everybody raves about it but found it to be overcooked and overpriced crap.
"if that's the standard for 'good', i should open up a charcoal chicken."
yeah i don't understand the frango's hype either.
and i had el jannah once...
the chicken was dry and it was just super average.
apparently people just go there for the garlic sauce but i can't digest garlic so there's no point.
also i'm sure i could make my own garlic sauce and better chicken to go along with it.
"i ate there once, not surprised it closed down"
their rotis are still the best in my opinion
i went there once and it gave me food poisoning
mamak in parra
i'm from perth.
first time i've been to sydney was in 2011 as a tourist.
i remember lining up there with family not knowing anything about it
and we walked away after seeing the eye-watering prices.
i visited sydney last feb and finally got the chance and the money to eat there.
"i think the roti is fantastic, but whenever i read about mamak here on reddit, it seems that the locals just fatigued on the place."
what did i miss about mamak for over 13 years that it's gotten this commentary now
went there a couple months ago.
they lean heavily on 'it's the opera house' and charge insane prices for what it is.
the fact that it's not too far off quay pricing blows my mind.
"yeah, i don't see a lot of hype for it though."
i mean if i was paying that much for food it would be practically impossible for it to meet my expectations.
oncore is an experience.
it's miles above similarly hyped places.
yes you pay but it seems genuinely world class.
i'd say oncore is the best fine dining experience in sydney
i think it's the classic 3 michelin star french fine dining that is nice but feels so boring and the service too attentive to the point of feeling overbearing the view is spectacular though
i like the ginger brle tart
ginger brulee tart.
just get that.
i don't go there for anything else.
i think their sourdough is among the best
"yeah had a croissant from there - cold, small and just stale"
"ugh the pies had the worst pastry, filling was quite acceptable though"
"before they franchised, they were fantastic."
now they're like any other random cafe with average pastries at best
oooh i have to disagree i love their almond croissant - sooo much frangipane filling
the happy hour menu is fantastic though.
"cheap cocktails, snacks and mains with live jazz in the background makes it a winner."
my only complaint here is the long wait times to get a table.
the banquet is expensive but it is an insane amount of food
they call me hubie doe
yeah i really feel hubert has taken a dive of late.
"3 years ago it was fantastic, now it just feels like a place for instagrammers."
why wouldn't you want to pay 10 for a single jatz s
what did t you like about kiln i've been 5 times now and can't get enough
been on the list for years.
could just never afford it.
"on my visit there, one of the courses was a crumpet which they announced ostentatiously as if it was a totally amazing new dish they invented from scratch."
"hey it was quite the delicious crumpet, but...it's still a crumpet."
same i am a little disappointed
yeah the betty's burger thing i can't wrap my head around.
so average and ridiculously over priced.
but yet the they are packed every day
nandos is better than the dry chickens at el jannah's.
if we going fast food i will add guzman gomez.
burritos are just ball of flavourless rice and anything else i have tried has been thoroughly underwhelming
sour cream on steak tartare.
holy mary and joseph and the baby donkey no.
that laksa slaps tho
won't hear a bad word about messina.
1 for messina.
gelatissimo is so much better for gelato.
"messina is ordinary, but a couple notches above soft serves."
"and why name it messina of all places in sicilyitaly messina as a city is famous for its granita on brioche, not its gelato"
like it's very nice but not worth the crazy prices
"i've been here twice and food was amazing both times, maybe it's what you ordered"
"i liked this restaurant, only been fie a saturday lunch, it was relaxed but food was great produce done well"
clems is great.
the potato bake and garlic potato balls are fantastic
"i used to say the same then when i lived in newtown i bought into the hype more an more, i find clems really shines with the sides, chicken schnitzel an fried chicken slap too"
probably the worst place i've been to on my culinary adventures
everything is so salty
"so hit and miss, got terrible food poisoning once"
agree been twice over the years.
"first time terrible, 2nd time much better but still just ok."
and it was paid for by my employer at the time so cost me nothing.
ragazzi was tremendous.
those questionable crowd and crown are a match in heaven.
"kfc isn't food but they don't care, they love it"
"this i disagree, always full after the 4 hour sitting but not stuffed."
"floor staff are great - last time four of them came out, and right at the entrance of the dining floor, after realising our previous course hasn't yet been cleared, they all did an about turn and went back into the kitchen."
that's good training right there.
one of my all time favourites in sydney.
all the comments under this have put tetsuyas on the list for me
"a ""hip"" japanese restaurant."
"you think that's weird, try hakkasan, which is a shitty chinese restaurant slash nightclub and you can easily drop 300 a head on mediocre yum cha."
"tables next to us dressed in tracksuit pants running to the bathroom every 10 mins, staff that couldn't give a shit and paying top dollar on top of it all..."
i've had equally good japanese elsewhere.
yes nobu sydney i have heard good things about other locations.
it's a shame because i'm reluctant to try them now.
agreed amare is crap
the garlic dip at aldi is good enough that i don't have to go there to eat that sorry chicken just for the dip.
it was awesome.
now it is dry and disappointing.
i knew el jannah would be the top response before i opened this post.
"i don't know how long ago the ""before times"" people are referring to."
i first had it in granville 12-13 years ago and couldn't understand why everyone was going crazy for this overcooked chalky textured chicken with garlic sauce.
"i've had it at their other locations since friends insist on going, and same conclusion."
even woolies doesn't overcook their chicken as badly as these guys.
yes so obvious it's hyped up and freebies when here all the foodie influencers i follow start shilling the same places in the same week.
"their reviews are all annoyingly cutesy and cookie cutter i mean, who honestly 'cheers' a dumpling."
i unfollowed most of them too.
what tipped me over the edge is when they promoted fucking kfc and maccas specials lol
"heard from insider that they paid around 2k for a particular ""blogger"" to come and ""review"" their food."
i thought sydney food boy was ok still seems pretty low key and more about finding places out west hipsters are too scared to go and try.
it's not the standard for all restaurants.
not everyone is chasing negative growth.
there still some people growing venues organically.
"while it is rare, these places still exist."
doing the whole influencer bit is actually so detrimental to business but only industry professionals are aware of this.
you can really tell who was around pre influencer times
"went to ito on the weekend having not heard any of the reviews, and it was quite nice imo, but perhaps not worth the price"
fucking annoying place.
had same experience in sydney - great before covid.
i looooove spice i am
og chat thai is still a flavour explosion.
staff are obnoxious rude lil fucks
the sydney chin chin us awful...
needed to be left in melbourne only where they know what they are doing
should be infinity as o bar is not in sydney tower
"i also really liked masala theory in surry hills for more ""elevated"" indian and a fun atmosphere"
yeah absolutely this.
"i didn't think it was ever a foodie destination, it's a friend's birthday let's get loose destination."
"pista house in surry hills is okay for a fill after a few drinks, but yeah."
very true i used to go and order from there a lot but stopped around covid time.
"prices went up even more, quality went down, too much salt, etc."
the pizzas and other brunch dishes were average but the entire outdoor area and the view down the cliff is sooo nice that i can put up with the average food and visit there repeatedly.
"my first ever night in sydney, we went to thai potong."
got to look at newport in the context of being a pub.
"i think across the board the merivale pubs all seem generally pretty nice even if they have that strangely indistinct merivale ""feel"" about them."
"i like the collaroy too, great views from that second storey over the beach."
i feel like tottis is quite affordable with good vibes.
i think it's reputation as the place to brag you're at on social media can make it seem overated
my canto partner hates mr wong with a passion.
tottis is awesome value considering the quality and taste of the food.
i rate it.
"was there for work dinner, not bad if someone else is paying the bill."
but i felt it was way too loud.
"on the plus side, i noticed all the wait staff look like models"
gonna be pedantic here and point out dan hong isn't the head chef at any of these restaurants - he's the exec chef.
the head chefs and sous at each venue do the vast majority of the menu development.
dan hong just has his name attached to it.
vic on the park was fine before merivale bought it.
all they've done is crank up the food prices and put in a few more seats out the back to squeeze in more eastern suburbs kids pretending to be inner west starving artists
not to mention the terrible service.
we had to ask for menus after waiting for 20 minutes
some people havnt worked hospo and it shows.
others are just too self centred to give a shit.
"it's the same kind of people that, upon the misfortune of attending an understaffed establishment will leave a google review like ""they told us the wait would be 30 minutes."
we waited 42 and then they forgot our extra aioli on the side.
i believe you but may i ask how so
and the rats don't help
ha haha touche
"upvote for the kj, use mine about 3 times a week."
i'll take the challenge against any of their 100 steaks.
"for 50 i can feed the family with a big, good quality tomahawk steak."
how do you reverse sear in a charcoal egg don't you need low temp for the initial cook then screamingly hot temp for the sear
for anyone i've spoken to about mjolner incl. myself the food itself is only ever a footnote to the theatre of the place.
it's unabashedly a theme park restaurant and it executes everything well enough to be entertaining as a one-and-done experience.
omg nooo i can't agree.
my favourite restaurant is mjolner.
we happily pay 400 because the food is always incredible.
my partner and i have all our anniversary dinners there and everyone working in the restaurant always signs a card and congratulates us.
it's a sentimental place for us
"so maybe i'm biased, but we've been going there for 4 years and have basically tried the whole menu now"
and i've never been able to fault it
that's because most of them are no good
what does their watch have to do with anything
fair enough about sommelier's knowledge.
comment on the personal items staff wear is just snobby.
i guess i always just assumed that rashay's whole thing was being like a cheap family restaurant.
"unless they've rebranded in the last few years, they were very much a ""10 steak"" kind of place."
i had the sea urchin crumpets for brunch and that was the most interesting thing i've had there.
both dinners have been relatively boring fish with acidic dressingsauce
i was interested in visiting firedoor until i saw the netflix show and the bourdain episode in spain
just pop down to colesworth and get 3 full ones
and they do this shared steak situation and it's 260.
i've never felt more ripped off in my life.
so average we went there with high expectations.
it wasn't as bad as sea level but everything quite underwhelming.
except all the linen pants and lip fillers.
those were overwhelming.
recently ate at ramsgate beach house and was pleasantly surprised by that though.
had low expectations.
all the food exceeded them.
not super fancy or anything but food was good
"i should have clarified the ikea canteen food, not even their imported food."
"bar staff are good for sure, they're were the highlight of the meal."
lotus at galeries scarred me too much to even try any of their other franchises.
chinese food cooked by people who have no idea what chinese food is supposed to taste like.
and it's pricey.
first few years of sokyo were so different to what they are later.
after chase kojima left it was just terrible.
i guess we disagree on this sure
"it's pre-prepared, but it's prepared that day, they're using good ingredients and the execution is pretty fantastic."
worth the coin imo
"yep that was my experience, about a year ago."
i was hoping this was a one off and someone would disagree with me on this as i've seen on other comments but looks like its best days are well behind it.
sorry to hear so guess this place is just shit then
tell me when you do.
"meanwhile, where can i get good charcoal chicken cos it's so difficult to find one nowadays."
you definitely did not eat there than.
"i always buy frozen roti from asian supermarket, i don't remember the brand but the packaging is green in colour."
it's usually fluffy and crispy.
sometimes i feel like it's better than the quality in msia
but i couldn't get nice dahl sambal or kari ikan here to go with my roti.
i think so too.
"the queue is offputting, but their roti is still the fluffiest."
have you been to malaysiasingaporeindonesia
"yep i had the same for the one in haymarket, never been again."
but my friends say the other ones are good
"it's mostly that for malaysian food in sydney, it's pretty average."
"there are so many options for excellent malaysian around sydney these days, and a lot of them are so much better than mamak, which has coasted on its reputation for too long."
"maybe back in the day people didn't know as much about malaysian food and there weren't as many around, so mamak had the uniqueness factor going for it"
"maybe i'm just older and cynical now but oncore's menu and this ""experience"" fine dining feels a bit out of fashion like something from 15-20 years ago."
"yes an experience, for me negative, but i'm glad yours was positive."
their 'famous' sausage roll is the biggest disappojntment.
"carrots belong in a cake, not a sausage roll."
"this and also the horrible service, especially when go during happy hour"
that's not very fair - it comes with butter
the only good betty's i found is at bryon bay.
all those in sydney are greasy trash
it was disgusting.
i didn't eat it.
i have heard people say this so i'll have to give it a go when i go back
"possibly but we ordered a bit of everything, got the 200 steak to share, the chicken and a few other things too."
i think the most disappointing was the steak that was so over priced for what we got.
"bastardo wasn't terrible but just over hyped, all the pastas tasted similar and were not al dente."
maybe just an off night for each restaurant.
might have to give them a second chance now though
the place stinks of cheap perfume and deodorant
lmao i meant this as a joke
"i also disagree, one of my best sydney dining experiences"
tracksuit pants running to the bathroom every 10 mins the sashimi is off s
"you do know you can just buy the dip by itself, right"
agreed - the aldi garlic dip is really good.
i wish you didn't tell me this.
now i'm jealous.
"cause i've been loving it last couple years, there's 2 close to me."
he doesn't even disclose his ads
"his bad grammar puts me off so much, like when he says chef kiss..."
who is this
"i didn't say it was positive, just that it was common."
my other half works in restaurant pr social media so had a bit of exposure to that game.
"if it's done well, it can be hugely beneficial to a business but mostly it's pretty ineffective and generates mistrust, as seen in this thread."
i like how this relates to the post you replied to
yeah i don't mind totti's
i have a moral duty to push back on this.
they will skin you alive for a piece of their dumb focaccia and a couple of slices of prosciutto.
or some normal burrata.
and if you really want a glass of wine...
"well, i guess that's gotta be at least a hundred bucks."
food is literally not processed.
went a couple of times for the vibes but cannot stand the ridiculous pricing and won't be going back.
"i agree - i don't mind tottis, but it isn't anything crazy and for sure over-hyped."
why's that i'm sure their opinions are valid but i'm interested to hear.
"if you want real canto food you go to the burbs, but i'm chinese and think mr wongs is great for what it is i don't think they're pretending to be an 'authentic' experience, it's definitely elevated australianchinese cuisine but the dishes are always well executed."
i don't go often because of the price
i'm cantonese and only like the dim sum and dessert at mr wong's.
the main course fried rice etc is just offensive.
the best upscale dining for cantonese food is pearl.
preorder their duck the guy they have on staff is a literal duck master
i had the worst experience at a restaurant in my life at mr wong
and i agree with passion
"exec chef isn't a 'just has their name attached', like they are a franchise."
"they rd the dishes, design the menus often the ambience of the venue."
they select the vendors for ingredients and then manage staff.
it's not 'just a name'.
i mean at least they got to copypaste the vic formula on the alex...
you can still get it at rockpool bar and grill.
lorraine worked for neil perry back in the day.
"yes i thought service was not good, many of the staff seemed quite rude and stuck up."
the lady at the desk was very rude and unfriendly
"it's the best thing i've ever bought, my wife took some convincing but all i hear now is ""this is the best ever..."""
"usually get it to 225 with deflectors plates, and it takes around 30-40mins to get to 105f40c internal meat temp."
"you then take them off, then take deflector plates off, lower the grill grates, open vents and get the heat gets up to 350c quite quickly."
seer for 30-45secs each side and bobs your uncle.
i considered whether including that detail or not.
i think it deserves its place.
a high end restaurant deserves an appropriate attire.
it's not a goodonyamate for your disney watch tipe of situation.
he was sloppy both in his competence and in his attire.
what did you think of the charcuterie
even go around the corner to a charcoal chicken store and you pay less or just about the same for a proper cooked chook
knew restaurant opening in shire called fior.
promise it'll be better than everything else down there
to be fair my wife is chinese and she loves lotus at barangaroo.
"i have to say we went in july and loved sokyo, everything was divine loved the cocktails, didnt love the 600 bill tho"
haha i guess so.
i'll never forget the reaction from the waiter when at the end of our meal i asked him to take a photo of my friend and i sitting at our table she lives outside of sydney and since we had this place booked months beforehand we wanted a nice photo.
he looked at me like i'd asked for some massive favour and that he this was now hard labour.
"took exactly one photo on my phone and immediately handed it back, sighed aloud and walked off."
it wasn't like they were busy or we'd already been asking for lots
"i either use local lebanese run joints if i'm feeling lazy, which are usually slightly better than the franchises but far cheaper, or i do it myself."
"super quick, cheap and easy to butterfly and season a whole free range chicken."
yeah ok champ
i'm malaysian mate mamak does the best fresh ones in sydney
cannot just fly there every time when you only want some rotis.
all other roti places use frozen roti which is a cardinal sin.
is there any better alternative to mamak in sydney in terms of roti
there are others wow ...
i totally agree.
i found it a bit dated but not in a nostalgic way.
it was fine but not a life changing experience.
i can walk to aldi.
english is most likely his second language.
saying you don't like him as a food blogger is one thing but calling out errors in his englishgrammar etc is another.
that's not very nice.
"in my opinion, 'the if done well' part doesn't really exist anymore."
worked at the start but now statistically google reviews is the most used tool when researching places you haven't visited previously.
people have forgotten how businesses were built prior to social media.
went there once and asked for a recommendation for an easy goingaffordable bottle of red because the wine list is about 60 pages.
guy recommended two that were both over 300 a bottle.
we went with the only bottle they had that was under 100 which you can get an uncle dan's for 30 pretentious fucking wankers.
not the original poster.
"for me, it's like eating an essay."
"so, perfectly executed, common chinese food."
but not interesting overall.
"and also, no way would i ever take my parents there."
especially my dad.
he will throw a fit.
"""this much money for salt pepper tofu and "" yeah....."
i value my life.
he said it was an overpriced minuscule meh fried rice.
he did love the fried ice cream though.
not op but it's super ordinary food in a nice setting.
"sure if a business partner is footing the bill it's great, but no way i'm paying their prices for that kind of food."
"it's good, but not enough to warrant what they charge."
def prefer the restaurants in beverley hills say
"he hated the fried rice and liked the deep fried ice cream, lol"
in many cases yes - in dan hong's case.
he definitely does not do those things.
"edited to elaborate rd and menu design is largely done by the individual teams in venue, with some feedback and occasional pointers from dan."
"the ambience comes from justin and bettina hemmes, as well as their in house styling teams and the architecture firms they hire for venue openings."
"i by no means mean to say it's a name attached like a franchise, just that he gets a lot more credit than in my opinion is deserved."
"he absolutely mentors some of the chefs as they work their way up the ranks, but he is certainly not hands on full time in all of those venues."
merivale knows full well if they slap his name on a new venue then it is guaranteed to be a draw card.
reference was a manager at one of his restaurants for several years.
"wife wasn't impressed with the upfront cost for ""a bbq"" but now i hear zero complaints."
worth every dollar.
good to know - if it does a good reverse sear
then i might have to pull the trigger .
"so, write to the owners demanding the sommelier receive a luxury watch as bonus for christmas."
did you ever open how's it going
"well, then they need to do something about their consistency."
i'll look into that.
"as for doing it myself, it's far too much work for one person dinner also, using an oven the only option i have is definitely different from charcoal."
"i used to get it from naji's arncliffe but the quality, just like ej, has gone down."
taste buds are no good.
must be a smoker
"fellow malaysian here, and i concur"
"agreed, their roti is the best the only complaint i hear from some friendsfamily is that their curries are too spicy admittedly the people who have said this have low spice tolerance"
google maps tells me there are 4.
"my friends are from the north, so i assume they're raving about the chatswood one."
so no clue on the others for their food poisoning stats so far
agree on the price
"hey, thanks for elaborating that is interesting to hear as i know the hierarchies of duties are going to vary from venue to venue and merivale is a beast unto itself."
"i'll happily concede to not knowing what i don't know and defer to your experience, but at the end of the day as a consumer i've still had more hits than misses at hong's restaurants, i know he's obviously not hand making my noodles on the line but even if he is at the point in his career where he's putting his name to a venue and selecting the team to carry out a vision then he is still selecting good teams and building the quality of his brand."
it will be interesting to see what his chefs do when they inevitably break off and pursue their own ventures
we got a refund for that dinner.
the waitress was sick sniffling and handling our cutlery with her bare hands.
"it was the beginning of covid, right before the lockdown."
we went into a paranoia trip ahah
i think to deserve the watch he should first demonstrate some serious skills.
"after that, he needs one badly, so i concur"
we will try your new restaurant for sure always keen to keep trying new places.
they served me overcooked pasta and corked wine.
"the sommelier wanted to argue with me over the wine, so i insisted he fetch another bottle which i told him i was prepared to pay for if i were proven wrong, and guess what send me another downvote, you knob."
"personally, i did not enjoy my dining experience at est and neither did my wife."
i recently had a very nice dinner at bon vin in surry hills.
it was 250 for three courses and one set of paired wines.
"the gidley is amazing, great food, great drinks and lovely atmosphere."
right around your budget
"heaps, like literally 80 of places you can have an amazing time for less than 350 for two."
- ragazzi - poly - bella brutta - mr wong - tottis some of my favs
i'm a huge fan of hubert.
"reasonably priced, nice atmosphere and good food get the tartare."
try this list you will need to go through and discard the really expensive ones.
"as a general rule, if it's on the harbour, it's expensive."
pott's point and surry hills is more of a middle ground.
"redfern, newtown, glebe are cheaper."
"but that's a general rule, rather than hard and fast."
nomad in surry hills
bar vincent in darlinghurst.
fantastic italian food cosy neighbourhood vibe.
go to the gidley.
price is around 300-400 including wine.
"best steak in sydney, ambience is amazing and service is second to none"
i really like dining in the bar area at rockpool bar and grill.
you can either sit at the bar which i think is awesome even if you're on a date since you get extra special attention from the friendly bartenders or they have seating too.
the bar menu is excellent and you can order anything from the restaurant too plus you can ask for the main courses to be split in two.
my usual order is empanadas prawn cutlet main pasta dish split in two.
2 x steak dianneactually the most underrated steak in sydney imo or steak chimichuri from the bar menu or ribeye from the grill to share.
"side of butter lettuce, fat chips and wagyu gravy dessert to share wine their list is huge and extensive and you will find something in your price range, they've been known for one of the biggest private wine collections before and their sommeliers are excellent."
having said that if you wanna go the same old barossa shiraz route you're gonna pay for it but the menu has plenty of hidden affordable gems if you chat to the somms.
had an incredible 10 year old german riesling for 80 there a few months ago.
i do that menu with my wife frequently and comes to around 220.
"this imo is how you do restaurantsas someone who has worked in hospo for 15 years, little bit of this and that from each menu."
and it's a good amount of food.
"also don't be scared to sit at the bar and get friendly with the staff, i think it really elevates your experience."
good luck and have fun
china doll for modern chinese woolloomooloo kitchen by mike does shared dishes cbd i haven't been but have heard good things about poly in surry hills

food was superb.
service was wonderful.

cafe paci newtown.
"hits the price point, service is amazing, food and wine absolutely delicious."
"nomad, yulli's, calle rey, nel"
"mr wong's i highly recommend it, not sure if you will get a booking though."
hope you enjoy your time in sydney
"i'm just rolling through the responses, making a lot of notes, seeing how much people care about local eats and upvoting the hell out of all you beautiful, passionate people."
try sails on lavendar bay.
great food and view you can get the ferry from circular quay.
do you want a view do you have cuisine preferences do you want to share or have your own meals
the burgers are better at hungry jacks
"for something, somewhere unusual bopp tone sydney, the winery surry hills employees only sydney, misfits redfern, all of these come with eclectic decor, amazing service, awesome cocktail and wine lists and the food is delicious"
macleay st bistro

figo restaurant bar - beautiful italian food
kindred in darlington italian - hugo's manly australianmix of everything - otto wooolloomooloo italian - sake manly or the rocks japanese
nobu barangaroo crown casino has a great omakase set menu for c.180pp
lumi dining with their set menus is great also like the .nel dining.
bistro st jacques in redfern is spectacular.
pino's vino e cucina in alexandria is also fantastic both would sit in that 250 for 2 range la ricetta in enmore would be a little bit less
but it's just as wonderful
mjlner in redfern is fantastic.
nordic food and drink.
"fancy but laid back, and definitely not 500 pp"
"cho cho san , nomad , hubert are my favs"
food and service both excellent.
i loved nour in surry hills.
one penny red in summer hill is really great
kaffir lime is always one i recommend.
good quality thai food
"i second this recommendation, a french friend of mine says it's her favourite french place in sydney and i'd agree."
"it's affordable for what it is, and i've never had a bad meal there."
duck ravioli is particularly amazing but everything else is great too
i went for a friend's birthday and it was great.
one of my favourite places and i second the duck ravioli - it's amazing
ploos at the rocks.
you get the full harbour view with excellent food.
upvote for mr wong.
i'm also a fan of cafe sydney at customs house.
and their sister restaurant bistro 916.
also dear saint eloise nearby is great too which is sister restaurant of ragazzi.
like theres so many good 100pp range restaurants in sydney
hubert is fantastic
i went to hubert early this year.
"the beef tartare, and the bread and butter with some of the xo sauce from the escargot is great."
i wrote a review of hubert and put some dimly lit photos on my site.
250-350 is a great budget in sydney.
"if i could i would trek it to castlecrag and dine at smores, but might be unrealistic for tourists"
2nd china doll.
food is amazing and interesting plus woolloomooloo wharf is a great spot.
third rec fir chinadoll.
65 set menu is something i would kill for.
"it's been a few years since i tried to get in to kitchen by mike, bookings were a long way in advance."
i hope it's better now.
same for firedoor
the best sourdough in sydney as well carrot ravioli is a must try as well.
not sure when op is visiting but automata will be closing at the end of the year
ester was horrid when i went a few months ago.
the quality has absolutely plummeted in the last few years.
"1 star, do not recommend"
totally agree with everything you've said
did queen chow recently.
great food and price.
"went to chophouse last week , agree it was excellent steak house."
i like cafe paci i wrote a pretty glowing review
whoever downvoted this is tasteless swine
bistrot 916and highly recommended is great
but it's not owned by them.
"dear saint eloise is fantastic, absolutely stellar wine list."
that's a bummer.
i really enjoyed the food when i was there few months ago.
i haven't stopped thinking about it
and i don't even like desserts.
"i disagree, my boss and i went on an impromptu friday a couple of months ago and had an amazing dinner right in the price range not that i know, i didn't pay but every meal was delicious and the wine we had was outstanding as well."
galaxy s20 exynos.
couldn't even last a 8h work day without charging.
for me the nexus 5x.
boot loop issues that lg and google did not fix or offer any support.
just one random night my phone crashed and became a paper weight.
it scared me right into apple's arms and i haven't switched since.
i wasn't really into looking at specs back then
so i bought it thinking it should be good
but obviously i was massively mistaken.
that thing was an overheating piece of shit with terrible battery from day one.
it was sent in for repair numerous times and nothing ever changed.
that was the last time i'll ever buy a samsung phone and pretty much any product from them because they've all been terrible.
my first android - the sony xperia s. looked great but very awkward to use.
after that no regrets since i always do thorough research before buying and don't buy anything at launch
lg optimus v. my first smartphone.
"it was something like 80 in 2012, had a 3.2"" plastic screen, and came with froyo which i flashed to gingerbread."
"battery life was about half a day if i didn't use it often, and the compass frequently got confused and sent me the wrong way with google maps."
i only had it for about 8 months before getting the nexus 4.
some windows pos.
iphone se2 terrible battery life.
"best phone, xiaomi redmi note 5"
it was verizon's first 4g lte phone but it's battery couldn't really handle it.
like 8 hours with minimal use and well under half of that if you were using data.
the thing was just painful to use without an outlet nearby.
"beyond that, the phone just had average performance, was chonky, and the ux was kind of janky from what i recall."
"finicky touchscreen, slow, limited apps, no wifi capability."
i swapped it for an iphone 4 which was a huge leap forward.
"lg g3, slowwww, laggy and would cook eggs all day long"
the touchscreen never worked right.
i've been a nexuspixel user since the g4 issues and i've never stopped using google phones
anything that isn't a flagship
"motorola photon on sprint, that thing was a hot piece of garbage."
"nice screen and design, constant random reboots and freezing up."
i couldn't get a day where it didnt reboot or crash on me.
battery drain was a major issue too.
the lg g2 is one of my top 10 favorites.
really fun phone.
samsung flip 2 didn't last a year
the worst smartphone i owned was the blackberry storm 9530.
fave htc one m8.
htc touch pro sprint edition it wasn't just bad it was stupidly bad.
the battery lasted 2 and a half hours.
it died so fast one day coming home from work i had to stop and buy a car charger.
it would get so hot charging it would burn me.
i went through 3 all had the same issue.
i was very disappointed.
"i wanted that phone, but the performance was buggy slow."
by far the worst phone i owned.
even though i only owned it for 3 months.
samsung galaxy y young.
note 20 ultra exynos.
"overheated and lagged like hell, was always hot to the touch and just like every other exynos phone i've owned the battery was trash."
lg optimus extend 2 but it was 2015-2016 and i was 10-11 years old.
the phone has 4gb of storage and i could only have like 3-4 apps on the device before it ran out of storage.
so if i wanted a new app had to delete one.
and the screen was 480p.
i did love it as a kid tho besides the annoying storage.
"i was so happy with my lg g2, my first android after years using a samsung omnia w windows phone 7."
broke the screen of my first one in an accident and brought another one because it was dirty cheap for a flagship device.
"eventually moved to an asus zenfone 3, a midranget with 3gb of ram and 32gb of storage, which compensated for the terrible screen."
unfortunately after one year the camera started having focus issues.good times when brands tried to carve their space in the smartphone world.
i've had great luck with motorola over the last 10-12 yrs but i just get the 300 moto g power or similar models from before.
i get 3 solid yrs out of that.
"honestly, i've been pretty lucky with smartphones."
this zte feature phone i had though was terrible.
"all i needed it to do was be used for calls, and after like 3 months my phone turned into a garbled mess on the other end."
i'm still rocking a pixel 4a that had one of the battery problems.
"google offered financial compensation, but the battery performance is still pretty shitty."
"despite that, it's still a pretty good phone, i just have to keep it charged more often."
the storm 2 was actually a good phone.
blackberry fixed the stupid design mistake that killed the qwerty on the og model.
"but by then, the droid was released and it was game over."
the htc one m8 was a great looking phone.
htc just gave up like lg did.
"i also owned the droid, droid 3 droid 4."
my first pixel was the great 2xl.
last one was 6 pro.
i'm a writer for phone arena...16 years.
i'm working on a story about wanting to switch back to pixel from iphone.
probably will have it up later tonight.
i kind of a love-hate relationship with the pixel 4 in many ways it was a really good phone but the battery life was horrible and i don't mean just like in the normal horrible way it was atrocious.
i never did get my pixel story in.
"couple of late stories took precedenceios 26 beta 3 was released, and trump's beautiful bill gave the fcc its auction privileges back."
i will aim for tomorrow.
i'm thinking of switching back to pixel 10 pro xl.
"anytime you want to talk phones, i'm here"
"some people might think i'm crazy, but the worst phone i ever owned was an iphone 15 pro max."
"not only would it overheat like crazy sometimes, but the battery life was awful, and it would drop calls all the time."
"i constantly had bugs as well, like apps crashing randomly, big lag spikes, and the keyboard would act stupid."
"it was a sign for me to switch back to android i wanted to try a niche phone, so i got a redmagic 10 pro."
i absolutely love this phone.
"yes, i know it's a gaming phone, but it's been a fantastic daily driver for me."
probably my nokia lumia 930.
a fucking windows phone.
"only a few things ran on it and since i got it used from a relative, the battery was already down to okay"
and went to bad after the close to 3 years i've had it for.
"musical.ly yes, i still remember that would've cost while it was free on android or apple."
"my huawei p10 lite i had next was pretty great, i only replaced it after like 4.5 years due to a cracked screen and the battery barely lasting a day due to being on like 68."
my galaxy a52s has honestly been perfect.
"good screen though too dim in direct sunlight when watching a dark scene in movies or series, good battery life, good battery longevity still over 85 after three and a half years."
i got an s23 fe exynos from the company i started working for last year.
i have mixed opinions on it.
"for once, it's really snappy with a decently bright screen"
but it's got quite sharp edges and the bezels are thicker than those of my a52s.
it also uses a ton of power.
i'm talking spikes of up to 14w.
"it does play fortnite though, my a52s struggles heavily with it."
battery life is meh thanks to the exynos and its massive power draw.
"it also only lasts 2 min once it reaches 5 and gets really, really laggy."
htc desire hd that battery was horrendous
but i love their weather animations and sense ui and still miss it so nostalgic when i watch videos.
htc one m8 was the most satisfying phone along with iphone 4s white and galaxy s3.
those days were so joyful as we were exploring new techs in phones.
the most boring phone today for me is iphone 16 pro max and best value phone is poco f7.
samsung galaxy spica - first foray into android.
"was barely more than a limited tech demo, the whole os 1.6 and 2.2 was disappointing, the hardware was underspecced and it still ate the battery super fast."
sold it quickly and went back to symbian nokias e72 until the bitter end.
i loved my lg g2... until i didn't.
my worst smartphone was also my first one.
"it was a samsung galaxy exhibit, and was one of those free phones t-mobile offered if you joined their service lol."
the xperia z5 compact.
"it came with less ram than the standard version, which meant it was slow and suffered from crashes despite having a powerful processor."
"on the other hand, despite having a top-notch camera sensor, the software was terrible and didn't get the most out of it."
"it overheated a lot, and the battery quickly degraded."
"the back was made of glass, and despite having a case, it shattered into pieces and ended up falling apart."
the touch sensor was on the side and didn't work properly.
"this was a shame, because the phone was beautiful and its compact size was very comfortable to use and carry."
everything from samsung was rather bad.
"i had the xcover, in various issues like xcover 3 and so on."
"at the time samsung was the only supplier for ""affordable"" tough phones."
they were all weak in cpu and ram.
thankfully some had expendable storage.
the first was the only tough one.
the third broke from a drop of less than knee height.
that's when i left.
"also samsung gives you samsung apps for ""every"" google app there is."
that's double the bloatware.
annoying and useless.
"i don't need two apps for notes, or files, or pictures thank you."
i feel samsung is generally bad.
"sure big, but bad."
"i used some chinese models doogee, and something else they all failed within 2 years, which is too annoying for me."
"i changed to google, because i don't really need a tough phone anymore."
a good case and a waterproof phone are enough now.
and using a google android means there is only one grabby kraken collecting my data.
iphone 3g... iphones are much better than they were.
"back then, i was coming from, if i remember correctly, a windows mobile device."
"the iphone was more stable, but the stupid thing couldn't actually do anything, which was why it was so stable."
i only used it for a few months before switching to android.
"i've had some stinker android devices, too... back when they'd put 4 g of slow ram and a turd for a processor in them and call it a day."
"sony ericsson xperia x10 mini pro, 2010-2012 i honestly didn't know what i'm getting into."
"but finding out that my phone runs android and is updatable, got me intrigued and excited at first."
but it left me disappointed when i read that the manufacturer won't update to the android version that supports app2sd.
it prevented me from using otherwise compatible apps that took more storage than what was available in the device itself.
"android seemed like a somewhat standardized operating system, but - unlike what i experienced on pcs - needed heavy customization by the manufacturer to run at all on the device."
"this realization dragged me to custom roms, which was exciting for some time, until the always broken home-made roms by some randoes no offense, thanks for the effort made me tired of the whole thing."
some apps like vlc player or a nintendo 64 emulator were announced months if not years before release and ended up not being compatible with the armv6 soc in the device.
i was so pissed that from 2012 up until 2018 i switched to windows phone and only returned upon microsoft's announcement that the platform will be discontinued.
"i'm back to android, because i stubbornly refuse to get an iphone, but i don't hate android as much as back then, although i'd prefer not to use android and have a third option."
does the htc dash count cause that.
i loved my droid bionic my worstumidigi power 1 lol
2023 xiaomi 12 what a piece of crap.
"calls didnt ring system constantly crashing and rebooting lag but well... 140, couldnt expect that much"
samsung google nexus...
the battery life was atrocious
"it just turns out i was unlucky with the phone , used it for a month and it got to bootloop 2 times while also dropping from 98 to 89 in around a month."
the phone would lag scrolling twitter and always run extremely hot.
the rear camera especially didn't feel as good as the oneplus 12 i had before particularly the telephoto.
but yeah i was just unlucky with the phone
motorola g. i think that was the name.
it was their first waterproof one.
awful 720p display.
plain ui it put me off motorola for life
blackberry curve when telus did not yet have iphones.
it promised internet access but really that was just an hourglass animation app.
i still have no idea how to get music onto it.
"felt cheap, very creaky plastic."
"samsung galaxy note 7, the thing fking exploded."
too scared to own any samsung products anymore even if its now close to imposible to happen again
mine was the nextbit robin or the moto e4
it's a bloated single handed nightmare
iphone se gen 1
myb weir or as americans say you know
sht but in my family there were only 2 iphones.
13 and 16.
battery is shit so anyone saying it can last day or two stop laying.
they would heat up from watching tt on mobile data and just surfing with it.
moved to samsung and had no problems at all.
iphone are smoth but that all they are just phone you can have 2 options no customization
i need phone that i can change everything not just color of my apps.
"iphone 13, my current phone and the only iphone i've ever used."
moving back to android after retiring this.
"lg g4 and iphone 12 pro max..... the lg had a horrible battery and cell reception, the iphone 12 pro max had cell connectivity issues"
"poco , os was a joke , it was like using a developer build."
don't know how people like that junk.
for me maybe the asus zenfone 2.
i don't call it the worst totally since i've been using it for past 3 years until i replaced it with galaxy s8.
my only issue with that is the x86 architecture it has because of intel processor on it and intel dropping support for it so it hurts some app compatibilities.
"even though it is 64-bit capable, it is limited to run on 32-bit because of x86 architecture."
poor battery life also because of excessive heating sometimes.
"overall, i enjoyed using it because its the 1st smartphone that has 4gb of ram where other manufacturers still stucked to 2-3gb and 64gb storage that time was massive at affordable price where that time this storage is only limited to flagships."
12 pro max.
legitimately have no idea how people like ios.
was a terrible experience.
redmi note 12 pro 4g. even my old phone redmi note 6 pro works smoother
"xiaomi mi 10 lite had great experience with xiaomi before and after having this, but it sucked."
"battery got bad really fast, fingerprint sensor started malfunctioning and just ""disappeared"" from settings, power onoff button stopped working soon after that"
so i had to use workarounds to turn the phone on or off.
"yeah, it sucked."
also an expensive slider phone from samsung i don't remember the type that kept malfunctioning straight out of the box.
"after multiple ""reparations"" i just gave up on the brand for a long time."
samsung galaxy nexus.
always the cheap ones.
i had a motorola moto...
g7 i dont remember exactly.
maybe g6 it was around 2017.
camera not great
but i didn't care.
"big screen, nice looking and had that ""turbo charging""."
the issue with it was eventually the charger wouldnt seat correctly and i couldnt for the life of me find anything stuck in the port.
"eventually it refused to turbo charge, and after that it would only charge if i turned the phone on in some developer mode to bypass whatever the heck was preventing it in the os."
im not necessarily faulting motorola as it could have been carelessness on my end
but it wasn't enjoyable in the end.
another bad one was my samsung galaxy j7 sky pro.
it too had bad cameras but a weird glitch.
"no matter how many youtube updates i got, youtube never worked right."
it would constantly just have a black screen where the video should be playing but continue to play the audio.
no fixes ever worked for me.
"eventually i gave it to my dad and he used it up until last year to rub salt in the wound, youtube never gave him any issues... anything past that would be me bashing 40 dollar mid 2010 androids and that..."
that just wouldnt be fair
some cheapo samsung years ago i bought for like 50 after my last phone died a bad death.
just to hold me over until i could save for something a little better.
i do t even know the name .
iphone 3gs it was my first smartphone and my first apple product.
"yes, it was quite innovative with a nice looking ui, but omg it was so unstable."
safari was crashing as soon as you had too many tabs opened.
"after that bitter experience, i switched to a samsung galaxy s iii and never came back to apple."
"fun fact, the s3 was the phone i kept the longest... 6 years before a final brutal drop that killed it."
i still enjoy the galaxy s line nowadays and was never disappointed.
pretty much loved all samsungs s1 through the s10 series minus the s5 model
asus zenfone live.
died on me in less than a year.
"bad camera, bad charging port and scratch-sensitive that it looks so worn out in just a few years."
"alcatel , 60hz , sl charger 2.5 hours and 4000mah and bad batteri bad processor , everything bad only the price was 400zlotych which is really cheap but should have researched more detailed the phone market to buy better smth"
google has destroyed the phones i once loved.
"lg v20 - lg tried to gaslight the store and myself that ""amoled screens are allowed to have burn-in""."
"it was an lcd screen, store refunded me the difference and emptied it's stock of lg phones because of all the trouble."
"it would have been a great phone with better software and hardware support, but that's why lg are no longer in the picture."
lg g3 is the worst phone i've had.
"it was laggy especially when it was running android lolipop, plus the phone overheated all the time and the battery barely made past a high school day."
4 pm i've never bought another lg after that.
oneplus 8 - worst camera.
yellow grainy picture machine.
"motorola defy mini 2012 to 2014 followed by one of the infamous windows phones, nokia 635."
"it's a shame because the os was pretty much flawless, but the app store pretty much like huawei now, you had to do without google apps, instead you relied on sketchy copies."
"and no clash of clans while everyone in high school was playing it, dammit then i got a huawei p9 and it was like renaissance after the dark ages"
"qualcomm qcp-2700 from sprint early 2000's, talk about a brick of a phone"
the worst phone was the pixel 6 and in second place the pixel 8.
htc desire 816g. i've never sold any of my phones for malperformance except for this one.
"bought it as a secondary phone for light usage with not-very-high expectations, yet it managed to perform even way worse than i expected."
sold it four months later for a 60 loss.
"what were your best phones, i'm gonna make a wild guess and say it's the google pixel op"
what a laggy horrible phone
there was a oneplus a few years ago i had to get rid of in less than a week because of the curved edge tech.
it was annoying and unnecessary.
i had gotten it because it was one of the few with higher refresh rate at the time.
then also there was an lg that i can't remember the model of that had a 'leather' back that would just turn off and restart randomly even midcall that put me off lg phones for life.
"lg stylo 6, the first one i got worked perfectly fine for me... until it got water damage and i had to get a replacement."
the 2nd one was hell.
"idk wtf they did to it, but it always froze, or force shut down apps."
got super annoying pretty fast
"so i got a replacement the next would me the motorola g power... that one was pretty laggy honestly, got annoying quickly."
also force shut down apps
the cheap-ass att calypso i was given when they shut down 3g.
nexus 5 x or the lg optimus g pro.
"the exynos chip in it was inefficient, the phone was constantly overheating and stuttering."
battery held for half to 34 of a day maximum.
"finally one month after end of warranty, after official update, the phone overheated affecting the motherboard and the phone is stuck in a booting loop and unusable."
of course samsung denied any responsibility.
never buying a samsung again.
"motorola a1000. chunky, heavy, lacked everything, and had the least responsive touch screen i have ever experienced."
always been a huge sony fan.
they made 1 bad model though.
the xperia z3.
"the phone was based of a regular z3, but made thinner."
this of course resulted in really poor cooling.
"so whenever i tried to take photos in summer, the phone would instantly close the camera dude to overheating, making the camara rather useless."
xiaomi mi 11 followed by samsung galaxy s22 ultra exynos.
both got hot and battery was unreliable.
"xiaomi developed a faulty battery that got replaced, weeks later the phone died."
they replaced it with a brand new xiaomi 12 and i sold that one asap.
lg g flex 2
zenfone go 2015 and a nubia z60 ultra lv
xperia z3 the phone got hot like a iron box lg flex2... was an awesome phone until bootloop
multitouch was limited to two points.
"it was impossible to turn off the boot sound, and at the same time long pressing the power button would reboot."
so you'd hear the boot sound regularly.
samsung i5700 spica.
it was half baked product.
other one o think is htc desire hd.
this phone was getting hoot
xiaomi redmi 9a its my work phone...
"god, what a laggy, unresponsive low quality piece of trash"
"i bought it because i needed a rugged phone to take camping, to music festivals, canoeing etc."
"it also has really good specs for a rugged phone, which i wanted as i want to be able to use it for everything i use my normal phone for."
the downside i had no idea it was possible to implement stock android this wrong.
"it's incredibly buggy, crashes in weird ways, can't even make phone calls properly at times it doesn't have sound until i turn the loudspeaker mode on and off again, etc."
the gps they claimed is super accurate because they also use galileo and glonas is probably the least accurate of all devices i owned.
"for the entire three years i had this phone, it received one single update just called ""some bugfixes""."
it did actually fix a bug where it would randomly restart several times a day
so that's good
i guess it's such a shame because except for that it's actually good.
"the battery life is great and when it's not bugging out, it can do everything i need."
samsung galaxy note 8 exynos version.
the phone was very fragile and i got the back nicked within a month despite having a case and the battery life always was bad.
sony xperia xz3
galaxy s22 exynos.
atrocious battery life.
i had a droid razr and it was alright
i had lg viewty and the screen was annoying since it was resistive
but this was in like 2007 lol
galaxy j3 2017.
worst iphone i've used was the 8 plus only because of how underwhelming it was.
it's criminal how that fruit company can get away with that.
immediately made to the jump back to android and got an s8 .
worst android was probably my htc evo- got it at a time that my carrier didn't support the device
so i had to use a custom rom and that shit was sooo buggy.
terrible battery seemed very flimsy.
worst iphone i ever used.
changed to androidgoogle pixel.
best thing i ever did.
"my current phone, a galaxy s25."
"as a device it's fine, but its camera is severely disappointing, since samsung has been using the same small camera sensor for 4 years now."
the s25 in particular is actually worse than its predecessor in how it handles post processing for photos.
"other than that, nothing is improved on it from the 24."
"battery life struggles, software is janky and attempting to copy apple at every turn."
if i wanted to use ios i'd kept my iphone
iphone xs as a replacement while my s23u was in the mail.
"i hated the modern ios, didin't trust the facial recognition system and the battery life was appaling even despite the thing having nearly new battery."
"my last experiences with ios were with the last good iphone, the 6s paired with ios 9."
the navigation system was weird to use and took a long time to get used to.
it wasn't fun using it at all.
"as a smartphone it wasn't the worst one by any means, that would go to the budget galaxy i had years ago."
but by far the worst user experience out of any phone i've owned.
o2 xda ii mini.
it came with several dead pixels and i couldn't exchange for a new one.
the galaxy note 8 was the biggest disappointment.
"it just never grew on me big fan of the note series otherwise, and then it died with a faulty motherboard."
worst flagship lg g5 worst overall easily samsung wave 3 with their crappy bada os
xiaomi mi a2 - got it after i broke my iphone 7 and realized i need a decent soc or i'd go insane lol for reference i have a pixel 7a now
and i think it's fast enough
"coming from an iphone 5s and an iphone 8 which i considered already way too big, i just absolutely hate the size of those monstrous modern phones."
"fuck that bricks, give me back the iphone 5s form factor with modern technology"
all mine would've been solid for the time since i spend a lot of time comparing before buying.
"but if i had to choose one, it would be sony xperia z1c."
"it was the only one that died on me for no particular reason like drops, spills, etc.. also its gallery management is horrible, mixing in tons of thumbnails with actual images."
this wasn't a problem with their subsequent models.
galaxy a9 2018.
thought it was gonna be a banger midrange phone.
one of the earliest to adapt the triple camera setup.
turns out it isn't even that great.
"but it's still alive though, i use it as my backup."
"motorola droid, my grandma got me it and put me on her plan when i was 10."
redmi note 9 - wasn't terrible overall but had constant ads imposed as system notifications.
some system links led to chinese pages.
at one point it just turned off repeatedly.
"it was also slow compared to contemporary phones granted, it was also a lot cheaper."
"huawei p10 or p20, can't remember - i liked it but the battery swelled shortly after one year."
"i know that chinese smartphones have come a long way, especially if you pay midrange or flagship prices."
but i have no plans to return to them.
apple iphone 11
the droid razer had the best ergonomics for me.
the camera bar in the back was perfect for holding the phone.
"we had two, my wife and i, and we had them for several years with no issues."
i also liked the slim profile and carbon fiber back.
"yes, battery life was not great and the display was just ok, good for the time i suppose, but we did not have performance issues."
the worst reliability was the pixel 3xl.
that phone always ran hot.
the wifi chip unsoldered itself while navigating during a hot day in florida.
the phone rebooted for overheating and never had wifi again.
the best was the pixel 2 xl.
i still have two that i use for testing and app development.
"still works great, with a good battery and still good display and performance in 2025."
oneplus 7 pro 5g. i came from a nexus 6p and thought the camera was subpar.
didn't look particularly good.
barely had any updates from oneplus.
good performance though..
but the lack of updates pushed me from any oneplus devices since
samsung s85000 wave.
it was on the cusp of the switch to smartphones and it was samsung's attempt to make their own os.
ended up never downloading any apps and did everything through the browser.
"pixel 6 pro. using it as gps during a hot sunny day forget about it, it will overheat and turn off in 30 minutes."
never had this problem with any other phone.
iphone 12 pro and 15pro.
"for what you pay for, these things are pure shit......"
s22 ultra exynos
asus with the intel atom processor
"the worst phone i ever owned was the razer phone 1337, which i imported from the usa."
"it worked fine for about a week, but then the fingerprint sensor on the side stopped working."
"i complained, and they took the phone back and sent me a replacement, which took two weeks."
"unfortunately, after about two weeks with the new device, the earpiece stopped working."
i returned that device as well and finally got a full refund.
windows phone 7.
"i bought into the whole ""windows system will be the next iphone killer"" mentality."
"my friend had an android phone and we were comparing my utorrent app which i used to monitor my downloads from my computer on my windows phone, and his phone literally just had utorrent."
i was surprised that the app could be on a phone at that time.
"but what really shattered my delusions on this phone was when i was reading the description of the upcoming update on my phone to brag to him and came across the ability to ""copy and paste""."
he laughed his ass off.
i hadn't realized that for the few months that i'd had the phone there was never an option to copy or paste anything.
they had a really cool 3d puzzle game to show off how powerful this phone was but no damn copypaste.
i was done at that point and i bought my first samsung galaxy.
"probably the galaxy s20 fe 5g. it was laggy, overheated and barely lasted half a day."
galaxy s22 ultra might be the second one.
pixel 7 pro.
that thing could not hold a phone call.
"mobile reception was terrible, wifi calling didn't work, all in places where previous phones were fine."
the 6 prior to that and the pixel 8 pro weren't much better.
totally put me off trying another one since.
"lg g5 .the battery life was hideous, i would have to charge multiple times because the battery drains like hell."
redmi note 8
google pixel 7 and 8.first gen sensor chip great camera shite software for the things you need a phone for.
buggy and unreliable.
"any phone that had reddit hype around them like early iphones same reasons why the main developer that made jailbreaking possible moved to the fold, and half of the google phones from dev phone to pixels, though nexuses were great."
"the phones with most complaints were the best, like the galaxy."
"though i also like few phones besides galaxy, those brands were far more inconsistent for me to like them."
"combining my experience with the nexus phones and the galaxy phones, i realised that samsung is most consistently great, and prioritised what i prioritised."
"i don't think it was the best or the worst, but i also loved the g2."
"fortunately, it worked fine for me for a long time though."
motorola razr 2023 the battery sucks.
xiaomi 14t pro.
and i imagine every other xiaomi is more or less the same.
"notifications and control panel are separated, in an apple style, and you can't change it."
it is cluttered and annoying to use.
"""system optimization"" is ass, not in the way that it does nothing, but that it does too much, in every wrong way."
"it locks some games to 60, 144hz screen sees 120 fps 3 times a day, battery charges fast but discharges too fast 0-100 in 40 mins, 100-0 in a day and a half with mild usage, 5-6h of videos and 4h of gaming, heats up fast and a lot hits 50c really easily."
"i bought it to record in 60 fps, 1080p while also playing at 120 fps without worrying about overheating or frame drops, and it should easily do that, with a mediatek 9300 marginally better than a snapdragon 8 gen 3, found on the s24 ultra for example."
"the cameras are nice, but the software downright suuuuuckkssss."
"i've used a huawei p smart and, while slower, i liked the ui a lot more."
tecno camon 20 pro 4g i just want a 2nd phone for socmed
but it sucks its lagging when i open 3 to 4 apps
"i'll properly upgrade next year or the year after, if it lasts that long it doesn't get worse battery wise."
"i'll get something ""old"" though, like the 9 or 10 if there is any ..."
these days you never know about the numbers.
that's because i'll pay once and be done with it - and don't want to pay more than 10 of what i make a month.
it's just not worth more in my opinion.
iphone 5 was dead by the time i got to work i had to charge it all day just to use it.
there was a class action lawsuit because they were found guilty of deliberately releasing software to slow down the older phones to encourage new purchases
but of course my serial number didn't qualify.
kyorcra duraforce i believe it was called.
it had one of those off year snapdragon processors that overheated doing basic tasks.
i thought it was a japanese phone and being water resistant would be cool.
boy was i wrong thinking that.
i only used it for a day and i think either returned it or flipped it.
one plus 7 the bastard started getting switch off dozens of times everyday even in the middle of a call.
this started happening post android version update.
when i checked online even on their website forum there were so many people facing the same issue and company couldn't fix it.
such an expensive phone worst experience i had.
i had to throw it away eventually.
i'm surprised it still a sought after brand.
after that experience i'll never take oneplus even if given for free.
"galaxy s8 plus exynos, trash cameras, constant app crashes and bugs."
haven't bought a samsung ever since.
"galaxy s7s plural trash phones, trash batteries, trash antennas."
just fucking trash.
samsung makes stinker ass phones.
my current 2ndbkackup phone.
the camera is for slow leisure photography..
the shutter response is that slow.
"i started with a sony ericsson xperia live with walkman.. and a moto g 1st gen, nokia lumia etc.. even with their low specs they were better performers for their time than the m14 is for 2025."
its an entry level phone.. but any motorola in the same price range can outperform it in speed anytime.
samsung a05 64gb ... creeps me out daily
htc desire c. pretty and all but the battery lasted only an hour or two.
free phone the provider gave me.
first smartphone i owned.
it just wasn't really functional in a meaningful way.
i ended up not being accessable and my family called the cops to find me lol
"mine also lg, it's been robbed by me...fk"
honestly pixel 6a.
i really like the phone everything about it.
but battery life is not good and everywhere i see after 400 charge cycles it will be horrendous
and i am at 300.
i bought it with a mind of using it for 2 yrs.
actually it is a really good phone hut i just am so fixated on a good battery and the seller said the battery is perfect which isn't.
and it heats up
"htc 10, was meh from day one and completely decayed after a year or two."
made a mistake buying it instead of galaxy s7 or mi6 in 2017.
or if i count anything i used short-term too - xperia 5-2.
it was so awful that i sold it after three days.
"my iphone 7, but not when it was my main phone, when it was a side device on ios 15."
"slow as hell, got hotter than a stove burner, and had terrible battery life."
hands down the htc legend from around 2010.
it overheated while using it to the point of being unusable.
i wanted to love this phone so bad
and this probably added to the bad taste it left in my mouth.
oneplus 9 wanna know why read
"for my family it's the iphone 16 pm, my mom got one, considering the price of the phone it's absolutely terrible."
"always freezes, part of the screen around the action button has problems and stops working sometimes, it's always crashing, the camera is awful and processing makes it look like ai slop, and ios feels worse than ever."
"considering it was several hundred dollars more than the price of my 1vi it's horrendous, apple of yesteryear is dead."
"got it as a company phone, first phone in apple universe."
wanted to throw it at the wall every day.
"might have not been the phones fault, but ios unusability in general"
"i have a work iphone 14 that is a total abomination, bluetooth disconnects, battery drain 5-10 a day .. and it's stock it's a work phone"
so it has outlook and that's it..
"j3 prime, absolutely do not miss that phone."
the camera was lagging like crazy when the battery was low.
"for me, the nokia n95."
"it dropped calls, i missed important calls and, at the time, my eldest has just been born prematurely and my wife ended up so frustrated with them, we binned them"
samsung galaxy s3 back in 2012.
"was too average for a flagship phone back in the day, didn't even last 2 years for me."
"galaxy s8 the sound when taking a phone call was terrible, always had to ask people to repeat themselves."
i had the same problem on replacement phone and ended up taking it back and demanding my money back.
that was another battle as well. .
galaxy s22 exynos.
damn that thing sucked.
the s24 exynos wasn't much better tho.
i had one of the early razers around 2006ish.
it was not my first phone.
it was a big downgrade from my indestructible nokia.
dirt immediately got first in the flip mechanism and started getting crunchy when i opened it which pissed me off.
i was pissed that i had to use two hands for opening it.
"it was a full extra step, my nokia had the keys on the front."
i could take it out of my pocket and use it while riding my bike with the other hand.
couldn't do that with the razer.
"also, there was a camera and website access the nokia didn't have."
"this sounds like a huge upgrade, but they were unusable."
"the web browser hardly worked at all, and the camera cover got scratched very easily and was so blurry."
it also didn't have the nextel walkie talkie feature that was cool at the time.
close second was my iphone 14ish pro. tried switching from my pixel to iphone.
i couldn't do it.
"i stuck it out for 29 days, and on the last day of the return window i sent it back."
pixel 5a 5g. went dead in exactly 12 months after warranty expired.
sony xperia l couldn't keep up to save its life.
constant crashing and restarting.
beautiful phone though.
and i had the motorola droid razr.
"good phone, just lets down by a heavy ics update and being one of the early lte phones."
asus zenphone selfie.
why did i even buy it.
s20. died after an update black screen and they wouldn't cover it.
sony xperia xa1. shittiest build quality ever.
"apple iphone 13 pro max, definitely."
"i had a sprint htc phone many years ago, shitty service and phone."
ever since i've had samsungs and they last a long time.
my current samsung i've had since 2019
pixel 7 pro. biggest piece of junk ever.
"it overheated constantly, the camera sucked and couldn't focus worth crap, and i dropped it one time, on its corner, with a case from about 4 feet up and it died."
"barely made it 8 months, so glad i could go back to iphone at that point."
"moto play something 2016ish, phone itself was fine, little bit of start up bloatware ,had cool features shake and the light turns on, but got a blue inky screen of death in a couple months."
"lg aristo first one, iirc."
"the display was dim, lackluster, and not very sharp."
build quality was cheap and toy-like.
"sound quality sucked ass, too speaker was on the back cover."
one plus nord 2
samsung galaxy a04s
samsung galaxy s8 - i looked at it and the glass broke.
"samsung s23 ultra, its just batty."
the auto correct seem broken and the screen goes weird.
i've only had it for 18 months.
don't think i'll ever get a s series of samsung phones again.
oh sometimes it doesnt charge correctly or even hold kts charge too.
s7 edge easily as the edge display was absolute ass and prone to accidentally activating the edge display.
was bitter after having to give up my note 7.
"redmi note 12 4g 4gb ram very laggy,no notification pop-ups, overheating problem"
galaxy s7 edge.
"loved the look and innovation of a curved edge screen, sounded and looked cool on paper and in videospictures."
but in practice i would accidentally touch or do a gesture due to the edges.
"also, constantly had issues where the phone would be sitting in my pocket, not in use, would leave the house with 100 battery and it would randomly get extremely hot and drain battery to like 40."
"towards the end of my first year with my phone i had to put the phone in power saving mode to last the day, i had cleared the cache and uninstalled some apps that just drained battery in the background to resolve the issue."
"i wasn't familiar with android phones so learning to manage it was a little extra leg work, and even then i'd still randomly have moments where the phone would heat up and would require a reboot."
"after the first year, my phone had trouble lasting an entire day on 1 charge."
"then, if overheating wasn't happening, my phone would have random moments of being extremely slow."
"apps weren't well optimized for the galaxy phones yet, but this experience was enough to get me to switch and stay with apple for the next 10 ish years."
"now i'm back with the s25 ultra, and it's been a better experience thus far."
"google pixel , , the only true reason to use one , is spam filter that is bonkers , near perfect as it gets , hold for me , and call screening , besides that better not have one , their quality control is subpar and their specs should never be allowed to be called a flagship"
samsung galaxy ace 1.
this was a hand me down from my mother's phone plan renewal.
"i know it's a low-end device at the time, but it made me switch back to a nokia e63 which is also from my mother's phone plan."
"the samsung was not only laggy, but only lasted about an hour or 2 of continuous usage."
the standby time was also less than 2 days despite a new battery.
"it had a google playstore, but it couldn't run most apps without stuttering."
samsung galaxy a10e finally got a new phone good riddance
sony xperia z
"it was a ""gimmick"" phone, one of the first waterproof phones, i dont remember if it was actually the first one."
"as an avid swimmer, i was sold instantly."
"it had all these flaps that would close off all the holes on the phone, like charging port, sd card, headphone jack etc. phone literally fell apart in my hand, all the flaps broke off by regular use, lockscreen button broke off, plastic started peeling off."
"literally just regular, daily use, didnt last 6 months."
samsung galaxy 3 i believe i had this as my first proper phone
and it always had an issue
but i loved the cool things you can add like cases were fun back then etc
motorola edge 40 neo
"used to own cheap lenovo phones, it broke every year after own 3 times, i couldn't stand it anymore and bought huawei nova instead"
galaxy s22 exynos.
"i love the design and samsung in general, but the battery and slowness of that phone... when you take 3 photos, the phone becomes slow as my grandfather's computer trust me, it's very slow, and the battery just simply disappears."
galaxy a series
probably the motorola droid charge.
"it had some redeeming qualities, like being one of the first lte phones on verizon, and it had a large for the time super amoled screen."
"beyond that, though, it was underpowered, had terrible battery life ironic given the name, would overheat constantly, and had a lot of software bloat."
iphone 16 sucks
iphone 15 plus.
shock switching from android.
"editing text an exercise in frustration, for example."
blackberry storm 2. very laggy and bad battery life.
"iphone 15, i'm almost positive the people who rave about iphones have never used a droid."
"iphones are so limited in what they can do and what i used to do with just 1 button push, on iphone find myself having to push 3 buttons."
also with a droid to do things everything is fairly obvious while iphone you should probably read the instructions
xiaomi 12 with snapdragon 8 gen 1.
"shitty batery life and overheating for no reason, just scrolling socials."
but it was years ago
"nokia n96, absolutely terrible phone."
"after that lg g3, thing kept rebooting on it's own."
my sony xperia z5 offer not much upgrade compared to my old xperia z1 and the camera is so shit the comparable in price samsung galaxy s7 stomp em to the ground.
not to mention the battery died in just 2 years
samsung galaxy a05s
lg g6 that throttle opening whatsapp
my current phone the oneplus 12.
i would rather have a att go phone from the 2000s.
it overheats constantly drop cell network and wi-fi freezes up randomly resets lags out and so much more.
it overheats against so hot that it cracked the back glass.
it's in a military grade case and went through my windshield and was lodged when i had my accident and nothing was broken.
paid over 500 for it
and it's an absolute piece of dumpster fire
"no, i had the 6 and loved it until the battery went to shit...apple got sued for knowingly selling cheap and bootleg batteries."
zte by far..
"ultrawide was there but didn't work, phone couldn't do shit and display died in just over 1.5 yrs"
"huawei p40 lite - was too late when i found out google was not supported on this phone google apps, playstore motorola edge 40 - worst camera and worst software support, many bugs, including mic issues from day one and it was never fixed"
my favorite by far is the edge s8
"hot take, my galaxy s4 had the phone die at 49 and then i found it one day bloated screen and all"
samsung galaxy s2.
the touch screen was horrible.
rims first attempt at touchscreen.
htc one v and xiaomi mi max prime.
"they were both great phones, until suddenly they weren't."
the one v got outdated almost within a year or two of it's release.
"mi max prime's battery was amazing at first, then started draining quick after two years of use."
it was cool and sleek
but i didn't do much with it at the time
galaxy s3 with the loose battery and awful bloatware.
pixel 7 pro.
a heavy awkward phone that loved to leap out of my hands even with a case.
and yeah the screen busted.
samsung galaxy s7.
not because it was a bad phone.
just because samsung took years to release the 2 software updates you got back then.
only used it for two weeks when i was between androids.
how was even considered a smartphone
"honor magic 7 pro it is currently the one i use, in reality it would be a 1010, but the screen has a problem of excessive sensitivity, but i notice it is only software since it does not happen in the google feat news or in chrome."
"for example, when you scroll down on instagram and lift your finger, the screen ""sometimes"" continues to go down, just for a few millimeters."
"i tried a friend's s23 ultra, which in theory is the same technology, ltpo, 120 hz etc."
"but nothing to see, it has improved a lot but they still haven't solved it, a lot of people also criticize the camera, but it seems to me to be a ""correct"" camera within the price."
"google pixel 7, hot garbage"
"one plus 13 was the worst device i owned, truly awful in every way"
samsung galaxy s6 edge exynos.
the thing would overheat all the time and was always slow af.
"i did only get it for making my substratum themes for it, in the meantime i used a oneplus 5 without issues."
but it was a massive pain.
"i've had plenty of smartphones samsung omnia hd symbian, samsung galaxy s1, galaxy nexus, nexus 5, oneplus 5, galaxy s6 edge, iphone 8 during apple developer academy, galaxy s9 exynos, not great either, oneplus 7 pro, iphone 13 pro, galaxy s24 ultra snapdragon, finally a good samsung and the one i'm writing from."
i had a razr and thought it was so cool to be able to put mp3s on my phone...
"oh, i can't do that.."
i need to download itunes just to copy files...
oh i need to convert every single mp3 in aac..
my phone finally died just before i was moving overseas
so i got given an old iphone8.
"i will never understand how they got so popular while being such a pain in the ass about everything to use edit, it was rokr not razr"
htc evo 3d had a common issue that rendered parts of the touch screen useless
"oneplus 12r missed half the notifications, all apps were killled in the background no matter the setting"
simple - iphone
my worst phones-samsung s21 and google pixel 6 my best phone-samsung s23 pixel8 pixel9pro iphone13 pro max iphone14 pro
n97 maybe it was a sluggish nightmare but i loved it anyway
t-mobile g2x by lg.
that thing would overheat and lock up requiring me to pull the battery to restart it.
i tried didn't custom roms to try and get it running better with minimal luck.
i think there ended up being a class action for that phone.
second worst was the samsung galaxy s21.
it seemed like that one left half baked due to covid-19.
after 4-5 months of updates it finally started running smoothly.
that's the phone that got me to switch to iphones for the first time.
hopefully i'll be back to android one day.
"i like android over ios, but really like how well the apple watch works vs the galaxy watch i had been using."
i daily drive this and this crap cannot multitask.
playing apple music in the background while i scroll through reddit and am would just stop after few min. even switching apps hangs and lags.
"it had great features ultra wide camera, fingerprint reader on the back, and it was 2 x 1 aspect ratio like a lot of modern androids."
it's also the only phone i have had hardware failures with.
the fingerprint sensor stopped working unless you put the phone facedown and used your palm and body weight to press the back of the phone hard.
then it would work for a little while until the connection opened up again.
the sim tray would also jam and break off in the phone.
it was enough of an issue you could buy sim trays for it on amazon.
"the phone store broke one, and later i broke another."
samsung note 3.
i hated that phone so much.
iphone 12 pro my current phone
"pixel , galaxy and iphone are the worst it doesn't matter what model all suck big time small battery , slow ass charging speed , old and or mediocre camera hardware , etc"
"zte blade 3, laggy shiiit"
"a21s, good battery, everything else was horrible"
"anything with older mediatek exynos chips, they are horrendous"
lg optimus v. it was the virgin mobile variant.
it was terrible.
the screen would just lock up if you did more than type 5 words.
although the one i had at least had physical buttons.
i had a friend who had the verizon version and it had capacitive buttons and if that thing locked up you had to take the battery out.
the first mistake was expecting a fake startup to be even remotely ethical.
"the second was thinking its ""flagship killer"" would be anything other than a steaming pile of shit that basically self-destructed in 6 months."
at least the textured backing was nice.
for me it was the iphone.
got my mom a walgreens lg prepaid android years ago.
my know-it-all brother went and loaded the 16 gigs storage with a bunch of apps thinking it's a flagship.
almost killed the thing.
i had an oki 900 thing was a tank i miss those days when phones were phones
the pixel 7.
it has such poor network connectivity with both cellular and wi-fi.
it switches to cellular in places where my oneplus 8 pro shows 3 wifi bars.
"and then, it remains out of 4g5g network with just 1 bar where 8 pro shows full network."
it struggles with calls and internet browsing both.
samsung z flip 4
htc one m9.
"thing overheated like a toaster and the battery life was garbage. looked nice, but that was about it."
"my first smartphone, a huawei ascend y, which i owned in late 2012."
"it had 120mb of onboard storage, and i was always having to delete apps."
"a few months later, i got an iphone 5."
"the phone put me off android, but i'm glad that i decided to try a better android phone later."
"google pixel 3 which could trigger you by your username, op d."
"i loved the camera for the time, i loved the software experience, i loved the build quality."
"but it never, ever worked without issues."
"random freezes, even shutdowns."
randomly closing apps.
it was just very unreliable and a pain to use as a daily driver.
"i really liked the device, so i returned the first one and got another one instead, which was better for a few months, but then that also started to act up the same way."
runner-up is the htc one m9.
"i loved htc phones around 2010, had the desire hd, the one s, the one x, the one m7, and then the one m9."
the one m7 is my all time favorite smartphone
"i ever had, and the desire hd was outstandingly great at its time, so i had high hopes."
"but it had insane thermal issues, it got hot in my hand while doing just slightly heavier tasks."
"if i wanted to game, it throttled and had performance issues while being almost burning hot."
"other than the heat-related things, the camera was mediocre the m7 wasn't strong in that regard neither, but this camera was super slow and just unimpressive in all ways, it was a bit too heavy, and battery life was mid."
"i refused to hate it because i knew it's probably the last htc flagship, and i loved the brand, but it really wasn't a good device."
"at least it worked though, unlike the pixel 3."
worst galaxy z flip 3 close second would be lg g4
galaxy s22 ultra exynos that thing was portable stove and battery eater
i had the gsm version razr xt910
and overall it was great.
survived lots of falls.
but hadn't i known of xda forums i would have sold it.
it's greatest flaw was the plain android of most motorolas.. hardware that couldn't shine due to settings.
"just a ""1"" in a settings file and it had better video support."
update and custom roms available.
but saddly that meant losing the swype keyboard that was one of the best keyboards.
the galaxy trend back in 2010 ish was pretty garbo
iphone 6. was my 2nd and last iphone.
"sony xperia ultra first generation, just snapped out of nowhere"
"so far worst to date is pixel 9, which comes with the worst return process and customer service."
"i'm 62 and have had many phones, but this is by far the worst."
"apps not opening, screen freezes."
"it seemed like the next best thing, it turned out a huge disappointment."
"if we were to classify it as a smartphone rather yes, as it was already the 2008-09 period, it would be the samsung i900 omnia."
"the phone looks nice, but the screen... a torture the resistive screen display rarely responded to touch."
it also answered calls on its own.
the worst and at the same time one of the prettiest phones.
"out of 27 phones i've had till now, the nokia x2 was probably the worst."
"it lagged as hell and had a terrible app store with barely any apps it ran a forked version of android 4.2, without google services."
"the camera quality was jaggy, plus the microphone was very muffled, too."
"the only good thing was the design and its bright orange color - that was a lovely color three months in, i accidentally dropped it in the pool."
best day ever
the galaxy s21.
just inferior to the s10e in every way.
i needed a tie over phone and got the huawei p8 lite after i was done with it
i think i broke it that phone was the worst by far was very slow over heated lagged
"i still have s21 exynos, changed the battery, still have a problem to go through a day without charging i hope s26 will have the new carbon silicone battery with faster charging, maybe i will switch then if not, time to find another model"
i hear that generation of galaxy s phones were underwhelming.
it's really a shame because the s8-s10 generations were so good.
yeah same except it was s10e.
i bought iphone 15 pro after that and the battery difference is big
my s25 ultra is the same lol
"oh hey, this happened to my nexus 5x on the second day of my vacation to prague."
i had to fumble my way to a vodafone store and buy some cheap huawei phone
so i could continue my trip.
"basically everything was through my phone - reservations, maps, tickets -"
so i was crippled without it.
"however, when i got back home, google actually replaced the phone for me even though it was out of the warranty period."
"i kept it going for a couple of years after that, finally switching to a galaxy s9, which was a great phone for the five years i kept it."
whaaat the nexus was my favorite phone.
"i do think it was a 4 and by the time i needed a new one, it was no longer around, pixel was the takeover."
pixel 4 was great but the 7 has been the worst phone i've ever had
lg fixed mine and it lasted another year or so.
it was a good phone in the sense it was native android.
i came from the horrid early samsungs and vowed never to go in that direction again.
ended up with simple moto phones for a while then went to an lg v60 for a few years.
"same issue there, good phone but major hardware flaws."
on pixel now.
i know that was around the time of the infamous lg g4 bootlooping issues.
say mid 2010s.
man i'm so sorry to hear that.
what did you switch to afterwards
thank you for sharing i never had any of sony's phones before.
i had it and never really had any issue.
any chance you'd remember what was wrong with it out of curiosity
i've only had two lg phones.
the lg ally 3g which was my very first smartphone 2010-2011 and the lg g2 2014-2015 i really liked both phones but sadly my g2 didn't last long that would be my last lg phone
i had this phone also on virgin mobile also i rooted it and found some custom rom that made the phone usable that thing was full of bloatware.
i never had a windows phone.
i kinda wish they were still around just to challenge ios and android.
competition is good.
yeah battery life on the se models were never a strong suit
crying while writing this on my iphone se 2
"that was my first android phone and aside from the battery life it was great, i think the first phone that was capable of 4g but the battery..."
"you mentioned 8 hours, which is what i would get if i checked texts once or twice an hour."
"i'd be lucky to get 4 hours of moderate use, and always needed to be near an outlet."
i sometimes watched the battery tick down as i was writing a message.
"i guess it was due to the unoptomized hardware the handle 4g, but that was just a rumor i read on forums back then."
i loved the thunderbolt soo much.
"back when metropcs was its own cdma carrier, i flashed it myself from vzw."
it had a great screen on it
"but i could never get it to use 3g. just 1x data and omg it was slooooow, but usable."
the thunderbolt was my wife's first smartphone.
i still remember the windshield wiper on the weather app.
phones have come a long way
i heard a lot about that phone but i never had any of the htc products before.
my very first 4g lte phone was the motorola droid bionic.
"i was buying new batteries once a month because my thunderbolt was completely killing them, like they would not charge or turn on."
thank you so much for sharing.
i appreciate you sharing your experience.
"yep, i had one too."
it was cool at first but the novelty wore off really fast.
still considered one of the biggest disasters in smartphone history.
i heard about the blackberry storm.
i never had any blackberry phones but i did hear how bad that one was.
i almost upgraded from my beloved pixel 2xl to the pixel 6 but decided to wait another year for the pixel 7 series.
i'm looking to upgrade again to the 11 series next year hopefully.
so far both pixel phones have been outstanding for me in terms of reliability and performance.
"had the pixel 6 pro, it sucked."
"the modem in that thing was awful, stuck with tsmc made qualcomm after that"
i loved my g2 but mine malfunctioned way too soon and i would've gotten the g3
but i decided to go with the galaxy s6 and looking back i'm glad i did
fellow google phone user here i've been team pixel since owning my beloved pixel 2xl which i had for 5 years.
i never had a phone that long.
it worked flawlessly the whole time i had it.
i now have the pixel 7 which i've had since launch and it's been rock solid for almost 3 years now.
i'm hooked on google's software and i don't see myself going with any other phones for the foreseeable future.
i'm planning to upgrade to the pixel 11 series next year hopefully and this time i want the pro xl model.
oh the bend gate phone
what has been your worst one yet
i so wish my g2 was stable.
i loved that phone.
it was one of the best phones i've used when it worked properly.
i'm pretty bummed that it didn't last longer.
"i had a photon, probably one of my most fondest phones i had."
worst phone i had was a 13 pro max.
"ios keyboard is horrible and had baseband issues, so i would lose service."
cell calling is completely dead even if i pay the debt to unlock it.
cant even update ios as it needs the baseband to do so...
my flip 3 lasted about 5 months.
took them 8 months to refund me.
man that's terrible
i heard how infamous the blackberry storm was for the wrong reasons lol.
i also heard how legendary the htc one m8 was.
i never had a chance to use any htc products before they went away unfortunately
man that sounds like a nightmare
oh wow that brings back memories.
"the kind of phone you'd lose in your pocket, even if you don't have anything else there"
thank you for sharing.
yeah i don't know what happened with the s20 and note 20 generation.
samsung definitely wasn't on the top of their game with that series
oh my goodness that sounds super limiting lol.
i really wanted my lg g2 to last a lot longer than it did.
i really liked that phone.
i'm really bummed both of my models were defective sadly that was the last lg i've owned.
ironically my very first smartphone was the lg ally 3g verizon edition and it was a great phone.
"it had a slide out keyboard, 4 physical buttons and two capacitive buttons along the bottom of the screen."
it was a great introduction into android for me.
i never owned any of asus products but am curious about them.
hey that's not bad at all.
i actually like what they're doing with their phones now.
especially since around 2022 or so.
my only experience with a zte phone is one that my ex had way back in 2014.
it was a budget phone through cricket wireless.
unfortunately i don't recall the model.
i know they have since ceased to be sold here in the us at least as far as i know
i hate that i didn't get a chance to experience the htc one m8 or any htc phone for that matter before they left the industry.
back then i wasn't paying much attention to the phone market.
i feel the same about nexus phones.
i wish i would've picked one up back then.
by the time i started following the phone market closely the og pixel was out and nexus phones were no more.
i had the lg g2 and the samsung galaxy s6 at the time before switching to my beloved pixel 2xl in the fall of 2017.
i've been hooked on pixels ever since.
i'm highly honored to have you post your thoughts here.
"thank you for all you do like yourself, the pixel 2xl was my very first pixel phone and it was responsible for making me a pixel fan for the foreseeable future."
i've had that phone for 5 years and it worked flawlessly the whole time i had it.
i didn't have a single issue with that phone performance wise.
i upgraded to my current pixel 7 which i've had since launch and almost 3 years later it's still rocking along pretty well.
i'm looking to upgrade to the pixel 11 series next year hopefully.
i want to go with the pro xl version this time around.
i heard the pixel 4 and 4xl had poor battery life.
great phones but bad battery.
i had my beloved pixel 2xl at the time.
i upgraded to my current pixel 7 after owning the 2xl for 5 years 2017-2022
i appreciate it dude please feel free to inbox me anytime.
i'm always open.
i'll be looking out for the article.
"i'm a lifelong android user and only had two apple products the og ipod touch which ironically was my very first touchscreen device, and my current ipad 10 gen which i really like to use around the house."
"but when it comes to phones, i'm android all the way."
the only samsung i owned was the galaxy s6 which i only had for 2 years.
it was a decent phone and the processor remained snappy the whole time i had it but the battery life was horrible about a year into owning it.
before that phone i had two motorola phones and two lg phones.
since switching from the s6 to my beloved pixel 2xl
i've been team pixel ever since and i don't see myself getting any other phones for the foreseeable future.
"i love their software, though i do admit they can do better in the hardware department."
man that's understandable i remember adam matlock tech odyssey which is a channel i'm subscribed to on youtube had the same issue with it.
i never owned an iphone as i'm a lifelong android user.
the only way i would ever own one is if it was given to me as a secondary device lol.
i don't mind ios when it comes to the ipad but for mobile i'm definitely android all the way lol.
"i'm a lifelong android user, but i remember when windows phones were around, i was really curious about them"
but i never pulled the trigger.
back then i wasn't really paying much attention to the phone industry but looking back i really do wish they would've stuck around and succeeded only for competition sake.
i want there to be a 3rd major os around to challenge ios and android.
i've only had one samsung phone and that was the galaxy s6 which i had for 2 years before upgrading to my beloved pixel 2xl.
i remember the s6 was a pretty decent phone with the exception of the horrible battery life about a year into owning it.
but during that time the original pixel came out
and i was immediately drawn to the concept of receiving regular software updates and security patches.
"plus the clean software really drew me in, so i decided to hold out for the 2xl a year later and boy i'm glad i did."
that was the best phone i've ever owned.
i had it for 5 years which is the longest i've ever kept a phone and it remained flawless performance wise the whole time i had it.
the only issues i had with it was the screen was way too dim in direct sunlight.
but man i loved that phone.
"i upgraded to the pixel 7 at launch and it's been solid for almost 3 years now, but i don't really like the inconsistency of the fingerprint scanner"
"and sometimes i feel the battery life isn't as good as it could be, but it's definitely not the worst i had by any stretch of the imagination i'm looking at you motorola droid razr i plan to keep it another year and upgrade to the pixel 11 series and this time i'm going with the pro xl variant."
i never had the opportunity to try any of the htc phones before they left the industry.
back then i had mainly lg and motorola droid phones.
"by the time i finally started paying close attention to the phone industry, htc was already on the decline unfortunately."
i hear how everyone loved the htc one m8.
probably a top 5 phone of all time.
thank you so much for sharing so you were basically there from the beginning.
i didn't jump into the android let alone the smartphone world until the android froyo days with the lg ally 3g 2010
yeah the g2 was a really good phone.
that's why i was so bummed when it glitched out after only 8 months of owning it.
it was super unfortunate because it was one of my favorite phones
thank you so much for sharing your experience.
unfortunately i never got a chance to use any of sony's phones when they were officially sold in my country.
it seems like they are pretty neat phones.
thank you so much for sharing i remember those earlier xcover devices.
i'm a lifelong android user but i've only had one samsung phone and that was the galaxy s6 which i had for 2 years.
it was a good phone but my only issue with it near the end of my time with it was the horrible battery life.
i then upgraded to my beloved pixel 2xl which was my very first google phone and i've been team pixel ever since.
i absolutely loved that phone.
i had it for 5 years and it worked flawlessly the entire time i had it.
i upgraded to my current pixel 7 which i got at launch
and it's been rock solid for me for almost 3 years now.
yeah the early 2010s were not a good time for many android phones.
boy that's definitely not the case these days lol.
outside of the droid razr and the g2 all of my phones have been pretty reliable and stable.
my beloved pixel 2xl which was my first google device lasted 5 years and it remained flawless the whole time i had it.
i've now had my pixel 7 for almost 3 years and not a single issue as of yet.
"my galaxy s6 which i had before the 2xl was pretty solid as well, it just had horrible battery life."
man thank you so much for sharing
yeah i'm with you on that.
i do wish windows phones and blackberry were still around.
i think it's good to have at least a 3rd major os available.
yep it counts.
thank you for sharing
"i liked that phone, you could mod the phone to do some cool things....when it worked."
i was so sad when i couldn't get a replacement bionic.
the battery life was really good and it was a great phone for the time.
it was actually my first 4g lte phone.
"i just made a post asking about xiaomi, oppo, vivo, honor, and post us-banned huawei phones since i have no experience with any of their products since they aren't officially sold here in the us."
thank you for sharing
yeah unlucky with those other issues
but i had that camera issue on mine as well
what did you go to afterwards
"i've been using the 14 pro max for the last 2 years and love it, sorry to hear about your experience iphones are way too expensive to be giving issues like that"
man that sounds painful
how long did you have it
i never owned any blackberry phones as i didn't enter the smartphone era until mid 2010.
i've been a lifelong android user.
i do wish they were still around though with updating hardware
it's a shame what happened with the note 7.
arguably one of the most gorgeous phones ever made.
but yeah samsung screwed up on that one big time.
thank you for sharing
what a piece of crap the nexbit robin was lmao
i'm a lifelong android user but i've only had one samsung phone and that was the galaxy s6.
"i had it for two years and while the processor remained snappy, i grew tired of receiving updates late and having duplicate apps now mind you this was before the one ui days."
i switched to my beloved pixel 2xl at launch and i've been team pixel ever since.
i prefer google's software approach more.
s10 was the best phone i ever owned
it seems people loved that phone.
what issues did you have with it
i've never owned an iphone but i have an ipad and i don't mind ios when it comes to that.
but when it comes to mobile i have always preferred android.
especially pixel phones.
i like google's software approach the best.
why do you dislike it
thank you for sharing i heard the lg g4 phones had the bootlooping issues too back in the day.
"i used to own a xiaomi mi a2 lite that had a custom rom on it, i no longer have it anymore i also had an honor 8x"
that was my best phone ever and still is a i continue to use it.
i switched it out as my daily driver 5 years and one battery swap later only because of some screen burn in at the notification bar.
the best phones i ever had.
your account is too young.
please wait at least 5 days to begin posting.
"i am a bot, and this action was performed automatically."
please contact the moderators of this subredditmessagecomposeto if you have any questions or concerns.
"how, could you explain more"
well at least it wasn't your primary device at the time.
"oh man, i'm sorry to hear that."
so far i've been fortunate with the two pixel phones i've had.
my pixel 2xl worked flawlessly for all 5 years i had it
and then i upgraded to my current pixel 7 at launch and it's been rock solid for almost 3 years now.
but i do know google has had issues with their quality control.
something they definitely need to tighten up on.
looks like they've made some strides with the current 9 series though.
what issues did you have with it
i've never owned an asus device before
dang man that's so messed up how long did you have it
whoa i'm really shocked to see this particular iphone mentioned here.
i absolutely loved my pixel 2xl
"oddly enough, in my experience the two pixels i've had so far pixel 2xl and pixel 7 have been the best two phones i've ever owned."
i got my pixel 2xl on black friday 2017 and didn't upgrade until my current pixel 7 in october 2022.
it works flawlessly the whole time i had it.
i didn't have a single issue with that phone performance wise.
i only upgraded to my current pixel 7 due to the battery being highly degraded by that time and also google stopped supporting it two years prior to the time i upgraded.
my pixel 7 is almost 3 years old and it's been rock solid in my experience.
but i do agree that google does need to do better with their hardware quality.
"i think with the pixel 9 series they really stepped it up, but they do still have some ways to go to really go to the next level."
man that's horrible thank you for sharing
what issues did you have with it
i've never had the chance to use a huawei phone before they were banned here in the us.
how was the experience software wise
thank you for sharing
i heard even the snapdragon version of the s22 wasn't the best when it came to battery.
if i'm not mistaken that was the generation that came with the snapdragon 8 gen 1 chip that has heating issues.
just wasn't a good generation of galaxy s phones all around i guess.
do you remember which generation
the motorola droid bionic was my first 4g lte phone.
i so wish i would've had it longer.
i probably would've kept it for at least 3 years.
i got it in late 2011.
wow that's really surprising.
what issues have you had with the 16 i'm curious
was that your first iphone
i heard the original was even worse.
this is why when it comes to mobile i've always preferred android.
"i don't mind the ipad or even the macbook, but i just could never get into iphones."
"i have a 10th gen ipad that i love using around the house, but that's the only extent i can tolerate ios."
what issues did you have with it
i heard that chip had some issues.
kinda reminds me of the infamous snapdragon 810 but not as bad.
do you recall which generation
"i had the previous generation, lg g2 and i loved that phone, but man it just didn't last long for me."
the screen went absolutely haywire
and it just became unusable.
ghost touches galore.
"i'm really bummed about it because when it worked, it was a great phone."
man that's horrible thank you for sharing
i've only had two lg phones.
they were actually pretty fun phones but after the g4 they really lost their focus and direction and just couldn't get back to prominence.
that's sad to hear how your g6 performed.
i'm really surprised to see this phone mentioned here.
it seems the majority of people love that phone.
i'm really shocked i'm sorry to hear you had such a hard time with it
what issues did you have with it
i remember that was a huge deal back then.
this was right around the time i started to really pay close attention to what was going on in the phone industry.
that was a disaster
i remember when zte sold cheaper phones here in the us.
i haven't seen one in at least 10 years or so.
what issues did you have with it
still own mine.
keep it as a portable emulation machine.
i rocked it as a daily driver late last year after my main phone died.
held up well.
"oh wow, i'm surprised to see this phone mentioned here lol."
thank you for sharing
someone else mentioned this phone as well.
they said their s2 died after only a year.
what issues did you have with yours
i remember when that phone came out.
it wasn't until a few years later when i really started paying close attention to the phone market that i remember hearing how that phone was.
i just knew in the couple of minutes with one in-store that i would hate the storm.
i loved my blackberrys but the torch was an abomination and still to date the only phone i've returned.
i remember hearing about the issues with that phone.
i honestly wish blackberry and windows phones stuck around just to provide competition for android and ios.
it's sad we only have two major os around today.
thank you for sharing i missed out on htc phones when they were around.
i had mostly lg and motorola droid phones at the time.
by the time i really started paying attention to the phone industry htc was unfortunately on their way out.
also i have no experience with xiaomi phones since they aren't sold in my country.
but i hear a lot about them.
what is your current phone
thank you for sharing.
i only had 2 lg phones.
the lg ally 3g which was my very first smartphone 2010-2011 and the lg g2 2014-2015 both were good phones but sadly my g2 malfunctioned way too soon and became unusable after only 8 months.
i loved that phone
so i was bummed i had to move on
lol is that the original mega
i remember only learning about this phone line very recently.
what issues did you have with it
thank you for sharing i never had an htc phone nor a windows phone.
back when they were around i wasn't paying much attention to the phone industry
so i missed out on many of the reviews.
what issues did you have with them
man i'm so sorry to hear that.
i have the standard pixel 7 which i got at launch.
i really wanted to get the 7 pro
but i wasn't comfortable with having a curved display
so i went with the regular 7 instead.
so far it's been pretty solid for me with no issues except the fingerprint scanner and sometimes less than ideal battery life.
but software wise it's been great.
i'm looking forward to upgrading to the pixel 11 series next year though because i want a tsmc made tensor chip
and i want a bigger display this time around.
yeah i feel you on that i had the s6 at the time
and this is what made me switch to the pixel 2xl.
i grew tired and frustrated with the slow updates and the duplicate apps.
ever since switching to pixel phones i've been happy with their software approach.
i now have the pixel 7 which is my 2nd pixel device in 8 years.
both phones have been great for me.
i do plan to upgrade to the pixel 11 series next year hopefully.
do you remember which blackberry model you had
thank you so much for sharing i've always been curious about oems like honor that aren't officially sold here in the us.
"i've never experienced any huawei, honor, xiaomi, oppo, or vivo phones before."
so this is really interesting to me.
i heard many people had issues with that phone.
i've had mine since launch and it's been rock solid for me.
but i've also had a great experience with my beloved pixel 2xl which i upgraded from after owning it for 5 years and it remained flawless performance wise the whole time i had it.
sorry to hear you had a bad experience.
whoa i'm super surprised to see this phone mentioned here.
what issues do you have with it
thank you for sharing i'm a lifelong android user but i've only had one samsung phone and that was the galaxy s6 which i had from 2015-2017.
afterwards i switched to my first google phone which was my beloved pixel 2xl that i had from black friday 2017-2022 and it was the first phone i can truly say i absolutely loved.
i didn't have a single issue with that phone and i fell in love with google's clean software and timely and consistent updates.
i now have the pixel 7 which i got at launch and it's been rock solid for me so far.
i'm looking to upgrade to the pixel 11 series next year hopefully and this time i'm going for the pro xl model because i want a bigger display and battery.
plus i'm looking forward to having a tsmc made tensor chip.
the other phones i've had are the following 1.
lg ally 3g verizon 2010-2011 this was my first smartphone.
2. motorola droid bionic 2011-2012 see my post for explanation lol 3. motorola droid razr 2012-2014 4. lg g2 2014-2015 5. samsung galaxy s6 2015-2017 not bad
but just had bad battery life near the end of my time with it.
but the processor remained pretty snappy for me.
"the razr was a good phone for the first few months i had it, but then that processor and battery life started giving me major problems."
"by the time i moved on from it, it was super slow."
that was the issue i had with my lg g2.
it literally became unusable because the screen just kept shifting and glitching out randomly.
it was bad.
i hated it because i really liked that phone but it just wasn't worth keeping it anymore.
i'm so surprised to see this phone mentioned here it seems the majority of people love that phone.
"i'm not an iphone person, but i believe the 13 pro max was probably the best iphone apple has ever made."
that whole 13 series was pretty solid from top to bottom.
i almost upgraded from my beloved pixel 2xl to the pixel 6 but decided to wait a year later for the pixel 7.
glad i did.
i'm looking forward to upgrading to the pixel 11 series next year hopefully
thank you for sharing.
"i never had a nokia smartphone before, but i did have one of their flip phones back when i was in high school and i loved it."
the original one
thank you for sharing.
what issues did you have with it
i'm a lifelong android user but i've only had one samsung phone and that was the galaxy s6 which i had from 2015-2017.
for me it was a decent phone with the exception of the battery life.
especially near the end of my time with it.
afterwards i switched to my beloved pixel 2xl which was the phone that is responsible for making me a pixel fan for the foreseeable future.
i had that phone for 5 years 2017-2022 and i didn't have a single issue with that phone.
it worked flawlessly performance wise the whole time i had it.
"i really like google's software approach more than samsung's, because of its clean software and consistent updates."
"i know samsung has gotten much better since one ui was introduced and their software updates have gotten significantly better, but man there's just something about how google does their software that makes it hard for me to choose another brand."
i've now had my pixel 7 since launch and it's been solid for me for almost 3 years now.
i do plan to upgrade to the pixel 11 series next year hopefully.
oh wow how long have you had it
it's really sad what happened with lg phones in the mid 2010s.
i feel like many of them had issues hardware wise.
"my g2 was a great phone and i loved it, but after only 8 months of owning the screen just went absolutely haywire."
then i heard about the bootlooping issues with the g4 and then the complete failure of the g5.
"by the time they seemed to get their act together, near the end of the decade it was too late for them"
what issues did you have with it
what issues are you having with it
"oddly enough, my beloved pixel 2xl remained flawless performance wise the whole time i had it."
i got in on black friday 2017 and didn't upgrade until the release of the pixel 7 in october 2022.
i'm still using the pixel 7 almost 3 years later and it's remained pretty solid for me so far.
but i know everyone's experience is different.
the only zte phones i knew were the ones that were sold by cricket and other mvnos here in the states about 10-12 years ago or so.
never had one though
thank you for sharing.
what phone did you go to afterwards
i'm surprised to see this phone mentioned here.
it seems like the galaxy note 4 was a pretty popular phone.
what issues did you have with it
it seems mediatek has come a long way.
especially the last two years or so.
oh man that sounds horrible
i had two lg phones.
the first one was the lg ally 3g verizon which was my very first smartphone.
"it had a slide out keyboard, 4 physical buttons along the bottom of the screen power, home, menu, call and two capacitive buttons back and search."
i really liked that phone.
i also had the lg g2 which was one of my favorite phones to use... until suddenly it just completely glitched out.
the screen became completely useless after only 8 months.
i was bummed because i really liked that phone.
i never had a oneplus phone before.
the first oneplus phone i remember was the oneplus 3 series which came out around the time i began to really pay attention to the phone industry.
always been curious about them.
i hear how infamous the problems were with that phone.
thank you for sharing.
oh my goodness that's crazy.
how long did she keep it
i understand that.
that's fair because i know google didn't use the best modem for that phone.
fortunately i've had mine since launch and it has been pretty solid for me.
"however, i'm looking to upgrade to the pixel 11 series next year."
"i'm hoping google switches from exynos modems, although the ones that were in the 8 and 9 are better."
but we'll see
thank you for sharing.
what issues did you have with it
man that's awful.
i never had an htc phone but i hear how great the previous one m8 was though.
yeah unfortunately many iphone users judge all of android based on cheap models.
they assume that android is the same as it was 10 years ago.
but i'm glad you gave it another chance lol.
i never owned a huawei phone.
"by the time i learned what they were, they were banned here in the states about a year later or so."
lol hey it's all good.
"am i a pixel fan,"
yes indeed and i'm not ashamed to admit it.
but i also know everyone has different experiences with different phones.
plus i try to be as objective as possible regardless of the brand.
i like google's software the best
but i know they don't have the best hardware.
"for that, i admire a lot of the chinese brands for their hardware."
"in my personal experience, the two pixel phones i've had so far have been the best devices i ever used."
i had my beloved pixel 2xl for 5 years and it worked flawlessly the whole time i had it.
"i never kept a phone that long and the only reason i upgraded to my current pixel 7 at launch was because google stopped supporting it and the battery life was highly degraded by the end of my time with it, which is expected."
so far my pixel 7 has been solid for almost 3 years now with little to no issues.
these have been the best devices i've ever used software wise.
i do hope google continues to improve their hardware though.
i never had a chance to try any of the windows phones.
man i'm so sorry to hear that.
my pixel 7 has been pretty solid and i have had it since launch.
"however, i do look forward to upgrading to the pixel 11 series next year though due to the hardware."
i want a tsmc made tensor chip
did your g4 have the bootlooping issue i heard that was a common issue with that phone.
thanks for sharing.
any particular model
man i'm so sorry.
what did you go to afterwards
i do remember the keyboard being really good but man that phone just didn't hold up well for me at all.
i actually still have it in the drawer though lol.
thank you for sharing 2010 was the year i got my very first smartphone.
it was the lg ally 3g verizon
"oh wow, what issues did you have with it"
"oh wow, what issues did you have with it"
man i'm so sorry to hear that.
that's really unfortunate
i know windows phones had the unfortunate lack of apps.
"i remember being really curious about them back when they were around, but never pulled the trigger."
thank you for sharing.
"that's what happened with my g2, the screen just randomly started glitching out very badly on both my original and replacement model."
i was really bummed.
thank you for sharing unfortunately honor phones aren't sold in my country
"so i'm not very familiar with their lineup, but i'm going to look that one up."
how long did you have it
your account is too young.

to me the s8-s10 generations were peak samsung
i unfortunately never had a chance to experience an htc phone before they disappeared.
i hear the htc one m8 was legendary
one of my favorite phones crazy to see it on this list
that sounds horrible how long did you have it and what did you go with afterwards
that's the sort of problem companies run into when they implement proprietary solutions instead of paying the licensing fees to vendors with well-established tech.
companies that use the snapdragon soc in their devices have to pay qualcomm licensing fees.
"to reduce production costs, samsung used their own exynos soc in some markets."
"unfortunately, the proprietary solutions are often inferior."
case in point oneplus uses proprietary audio tech in the op13 instead of licensing dolby atmos.
the result was inferior sound quality as compared to other flagships that use dolby.
"no, it was a great generartion, but the exynos' terrible standby drain ruined it for affected regions"
"yeah, s10 exynos was godly."
i could still use it today with minimal complaint but somehow they messed up the standby drain on s20.
s20 fe 5g with quallcomm was one of my contenders for my best device ever.
galaxy s8 exynos was awful
"never used the e model, but s10 is still going strong for me."
it's my backup phone and can easily do a full day of my usage with original battery.
really damn never had an ultra as they are a bit too big for me.
coworker has a s22 ultra exynos and says it barely manages a day so would have thought it would be a breeze for a 25 ultra.
to me the galaxy s7-s10 generations were peak samsung.
those were special phones for sure.
i had the s6 and went to the pixel 2xl afterwards
"so i missed out on those phones, but from afar i really liked those generations"
i unfortunately never got a chance to use any of the nexus phones because back when they were around i wasn't paying much attention to the smartphone industry as i do now
so i was unaware of the different models.
it wasn't until around 2016 when i started to really gain a huge interest in the smartphone market.
i had the galaxy s6 at the time and the original google pixel was out that year
and i began to be interested in pixel phones because of the day 1 updates.
so i decided to wait a year and got the 2xl which was my very first google device and it changed the game for me.
fortunately i've had good experiences with both my 2xl and my current 7 which i've had for almost 3 years now.
i loved my nexus 4.
that phone was fun.
you could mod it and do so many things with it.
i also agree the pixel 7 was absolutely terrible
man it's so unfortunate what happened with lg.
their phones were some of the most fun models i've used.
i just wish they were more consistent.
i guess lg redeemed itself greatly when i got my pixel 2 xl since they were the ones who manufactured that legendary beast of a phone.
"but by that time i became hooked on pixels and never looked back to either samsung, motorola, or lg."
weird but my lg v20 was and continues to be my best phone ever.
iphone 16 pro max and i couldn't be happier with it.
the last iphone i had before this was an iphone 5 and looking back i also absolutely loved that.
good to know someone who used that phone.
i don't remember all the problems i had but some that i still remember are - the navigation buttons very not very responsive.
the transparent light bar was cool but the buttons were awkwardly placed and needed muktiple tappings - wobbled like an unbalanced boat.
those were pre-case days so there was no solution for that - the camera button.
"when i picked up my 16 pro max, i had a chuckle because this phone has a similarly unusable camera button."
the camera in general was impressive and i bought the phone because of the camera memories from school days when sony ericsson used to have top cameras.
"man i really enjoyed it, i just wish it would've been more reliable."
it's sad what happened to it.
it was clunky.
rip bro upgrade.
what are you planning to upgrade to next
yeah that's definitely possible.
it was the early years of 4g and oems didn't have the hardware to handle the power.
especially batteries back then
"oh my goodness, that sounds so frustrating"
i had almost every pixel phones but this one sucked lol.
bought the 9
and it's a good one
and it was expensive.
awww man i forgot about the g2.
that thing was awesome and had an amazing camera
bent the first week.
i only have experience with a couple of the older pixel phones.
no real experience otherwise.
i'm actually surprised to see the 13 pro max mentioned on here.
it seems like it was one of the best iphones apple has ever made.
"i have a zte flip phone that i used last year, and it's miles better than that blackberry-esque one i described above."
"this flip phone has had crystal clear calls, and does exactly what i needed it to."
"the standby battery life is like two weeks, too."
"even got it ""new"" through ebay."
"ah well, live and learn."
the couple pixels with their two-tone back colors were definitely cool looking .
i'm currently using a pixel 9 pro
and it's quite a good device i haven't had any thing or any problems with it at all.
"yeah, i've always loved the capabilities with android."
"iphone is just a phone that works, and has a good camera and long software support."
that's really the only thing that it has going for it.
but the recent iphones have been a disappointing experience for me.
"even so, i still think the xs and 11 are the best iphones."
"my redmagic 10 pro has an amazing battery, it easily lasts me 2 days with normal usage, and maxed out everything, and 3 days if i turn off 5g, and turn the refresh rate down to 90hz."
"it never lags or freezes up on me, and it's instant as soon as i click something."
it doesn't have the annoying animation delay that ios has.
aaaah that was the golden era of phones there were new stuff in every next phone whenever we bought a new phone excitement was off the charts.
htc brought new beautiful interactive sense ui around 2007-2010 era and it felt really high tech during this time until iphones went main stream.
samsung brought amoled in s 1 and every one was criticizing apple for lcd panels.
"htc also introduced best weather widget and animations of rain on whole screen in the phones like htc desire hd2 ..desire hd wildfire etc. htc one m8 was ahead of its time with bigger battery beautiful design exceptional audio dac , sound quality and stereo speakers rare feature at that time and 1080 p display and not to forget ir blaster for remote control devices."
"this was also in 2010, i wasn't that much ahead the spica was 2nd hand."
"thinking back, the android version i refreshed to was eclair 2.1, rather than froyo 2.2."
it had a lot more features but made the phone painfully sluggish.
i returned to the android world in 2013 with a galaxy s plus
and i used custom roms on that.
the last version was probably jelly bean.
i really liked when android was desserts
i have a pixel 7 now too.
"i like it's performance, but the battery is too weak for my taste."
the doogee i had before could do up to 4 days with everything on.
that was nice.
one day would be enough but my pixel barely manages that.
i wish i could put spotify on an old style phone.
i'd leave the smart world for sure.
"they are all good brands im not saying xiaomi makes bad cell phones that one xiaomi 12 was a piece of shit, 140 cell phone, not even samsung makes good phones in that range apple doesnt even try xiaomi has quite good phones, likewise those 3 other brands you mention"
"i agree with the other comment, in the us , xiaomi is only compatible with tmobile and a couple more."
"but coverage is not as good as for samsung, apple or google.."
so in the us.
its just not worth it to get one of the chinese brands
"if you are in the us, do not get xiaomihuaweioppo... because they are generally not compatible with us networks except for t-mobile because of carrier whitelisting."
and even they might not have all the network bands even on flagshiptop tier models.
there are many xiaomi fans who will continuously give bad advice to naus consumers that the phones are totally compatible.
had this problem for years on the xiaomi sub. bbkoneplusoppovivo phones imo have better osui stability.
"xiaomi's uios is more buggy but for their fans, its worth the tradeoff for the cheap price."
i sold it and got the s24ultra but yea
i literally wasted 15k on that 14pm.
that's very bad considering i m still in college
"i had a 13 and 12 before that , but"
yeah i got unlucky with the 14pm
less than 1 year.
it is currently a paperweight.
i had 16gb storage model and it was nowhere close to being enough for its time and also it uses ios
idk why but all other phone manufactures are way ahead with everything unlike apple they present something old on android but its like first time use on ios
lack of universal back gesture and keyboard are my biggest gripes.
especially the keyboard.
typing on iphone is a torture while on android is a pleasure.
there are many minor issues as well.
"lg g4 made me hate android for years, i tried samsungs high end tablets and i still hated android it wasn't till i tried one plus phones that's the one i started to enjoy android again and get this my main phone now is the pixel 9 along with my iphone cuz i still own apple stuff"
really you must have had some really shit phones then.
"my family has pixel 6, 6 pro, 7pro and 8 pro among us."
so we still believe pixels are decent phones but that was a bad one in the mix to wholeheartedly go all out for pixels
the issue was with the zenui was too heavy and everything lagged because of it.
"it was my first phone, had to sell it for a le2 which was also bad as it had heating issues then i got a redmi note 4 which was perfect."
"let's say the entire device hardware is subpar to be called a flagship , do you know what happens if you use on your pixel a third party camera app instead of the native that google algorithm goes to sleep , and you get the true image from the sensor , sucks big time , subpar soc , performance wise is pretty much behind on every aspect vs other flagships at the same price point , if i'm paying for a flagship i want an all around flagship , latest battery tech silicon carbon real fast charging 80-120w , snapdragon 8 elite , dimensity 9400 , a18 , sony lyt 900 , samsung hp9 etc, we're paying flagship price for mass collecting our data and we still get subpar specs , i'm not saying that apple or samsung are better because they're playing by the same rule , ""it is good enough "" ,we don't need to change , and obviously don't , they're pretty much stagnant , releasing just minimal upgrades , but they're still using old ass hardware and tech on them , like the 25 ultra , fake glued camera rings or the brilliant idea of removing bluetooth of the s-pen , while keeping the price or rising it , it sucks ,"
"never have problem with software, google and everything works just fine"
i had 53a phone died itself after 1 year use
wouldn't surprise me if that was the case.
phone was good build quality wise and the 3d touch home button was fun to use.
the software was hell though.
i couldn't do 90 of the stuff i did with my old hand me down htc desire and nokia lumia.
i mostly used my phone for media consumption at the time as i was only like 14 or 15 yo.
not being able to download anything music and movies mostly and no customization and no sharing stuff with my friends.
i had to install this app called x sender i think to get songs from my friends.
it was a nightmare.
other than that it was pretty good for social media etc but eh didn't really care much at the time.
i only bought it thinking that i'd be able to jailbreak and do most of the stuff like my ipod touch
but i couldn't figure it out at the time.
anyway no more apple after that.
i don't want tim cook to tell me how i use my phone.
it got old
really terrible cell phone reception.
and general sluggishness.
my first phone was actually a nokia 1100.
it was absolutely indestructible and awesome lol..
"my current phone is actually a pretty old phone, oneplus 7t. it's been an amazing phone so far even after years of use."
"the camera is still pretty good, the phone is still fast since i don't overload the storage capacity."
battery is starting to show it's age.
once the battery gets to 20 it'll go to 10 and to 1 within a matter of a few minutes.
definitely looking to buy a new device soon.
debating between the oneplus 13 and iphone 16 pro.
what about you
"i didn't even really have major issues, it was just slow, and ran hot."
"i've maybe had worse phones, but i haven't had a worse flagship phone."
"my bad it was before that, the rokr not the razr"
i was so excited.
great performance but the known issues with app killing is truly a deal breaker.
having the app reopen everytime you change app
it hanged whenever i got a call.
imagine doing anything else with it
i had the samsung vibrant on t-mobile which was the first galaxy phone.
was into running custom roms and that phone was one of my favorites.
later i had a galaxy s5 that was bloated and miserable until i put a custom rom that was much more like stock android.
then i had an s9 and felt they had toned it down enough that it wasn't worth flashing a new rom on it.
never owned a pixel
but i had a nexus 6 briefly and several oneplus devices back in the 1 through 5 days when it was very lightly skinned and liked those a well.
going on my second year now.
i'm just waiting till the 36th month so i can upgrade.
to me my experience is subpar.
", for something called a flagship"
pixel 6 pro but now on a magic 7 pro
battery would go 60 to 0 and shut down.
i loved my note 3. and then looked forward to the note 5 until they took away the sd card.
then there was no reason not to switch back to apple at the time.
they've improved alot but still snapdragon is tad bit ahead
my wife had the g2 and that was a cool phone.
the power and volume buttons on the back were great
it was a pretty weird experience.
"like everyone else who bought that first model, i was excited to get a high-end-ish phone for less money."
the specs were really good for the time.
"but then the ""fun"" began."
"first, news came out that this ""startup"" was really just a division of oppo a big chinese phone maker with a 22 year old figurehead carl pei, current ceo of nothing at the top."
"then all sorts of issues started arising, with the company doing nothing to rectify them."
"when i finally got rid of it, the phone couldn't even make phone calls, because the microphones had stopped filtering out ambient noise."
i'm sure they're better now how could they not be.
but that definitely left a bad taste in my mouth about both oneplus and carl pei.
iphone 13 i think.
she kept it for like 3 years iirc
"i went through 4 phones in two years between the screen not working, overheating to the point where i couldn't use it, the middle of the screen stopped working and it started to show screen burning and dead pixels."
"it wasn't ideal lol great concept, poor execution."
now i'm using the ultra 24
i'm also glad that i gave it another chance.
"my second android phone was a galaxy s5, and it ended being my all-time favorite phone."
"before i got my piece of crap huawei, i had wanted the galaxy s3."
"i see memes comparing the camera quality of iphones and androids, and it's like they're comparing an iphone 16 pro max with a 99 walmart android from 2012."
oh wow dude thank you for the reward
got one from my employer.
regretted it quickly.
"and it was a real, problem for me, not just anecdotal."
i fly drones.
i once hooked it up to the remote controller of my drone.
"while flying, the dji app crashed because my pixel 8 became too hot."
it was scary.
i thought i was about to lose my drone.
yes it did.
but i was lucky that i didn't need to pay anything
but it was still a pain and all my data was gone too.
"no particular model, just iphone in general."
"the model i've ever owned was an iphone 4, but only because it was a work phone."
switched to samsung and never looked back.
though the phone that i absolutely loved was my lumia windows phone.
i went to samsung s24 ultra snapdragon
it's too limiting.
a lot of things i take for granted now on android are either not a thing on ios or eu has to force apple to introduce them.
"hell, you can completely degoogle android if you choose to do so, that's how much control you have at least if you choose correct phone."
you can't deapple ios.
"back in the day there was argument to pick apple due to better camera and screen, but it's no longer the case."
but my mother was using my iphone 6 for years after i was done with it.
"hell, she still has it and uses to play some dumb games."
just laggy and overall terrible.
"it's sad that they failed later on, their early android models were mega"
the one m8 was fantastic i still miss it.
i didn't have it for long something like a week to a month i can't remember if i smashed it or sold it
i think i smashed it was years ago now
i didn't know that about the oneplus 13.
that's a good point.
thankfully here in the us we had the snapdragon versions.
i just didn't like the s20 generation as much as the previous two generations.
"i think they were much better, design and feature wise."
"s10e exynos, battery drain really fast."
"replaced with some knockoff, was great for 3 month, now discharges fast as well."
"however, power saving mode extends life like 2-3 times."
i can only speak for the snapdragon models.
but i'm more so talking about the overall designs of those generations of samsung.
they were special
"exynos phones often overheat, and ultra phones aren't that big, although i understand your point."
"personally, i'd prefer a flip phone."
imo they were the golden era of smartphones.
"i can't remember exactly the models but lg made a nexus and google made one, i believe the google one was their first they manufactured themselves and there were differences in which android software they used."
the lg had a removable back plate while the google was 1 piece.
that google nexus was the best phone i have ever had.
the usb connector eventually failed as allllllll google phones do and i went for another nexus but they rebranded it as the pixel.
i had the one that looked identical to iphone at the time but had the round touch pad on the back.
this was my 2nd favorite and best phone.
"eventually tho, the usb failed and for whatever reason, it stopped letting me make take calls."
i could text no problem and do video call but it wouldn't function as a regular phone.
"tried an iphone again, then went back to pixel 7 and it has been frustrating and problematic."
"my biggest issue with google phones, the pixel lineup, it has problems connecting to pc via usb."
this leaves it almost useless for me as unload mine up with music and video.
it's a known issue that has effected multiple models as far back as the 6
i just can't believe or trust google with hardware.
every phone has the same 2 issues and the fact they have problems being recognized on pc connection is absurd for a smartphone.
i like the 9a going back to being sleek and battery life has always seemed above normal for me but not being able to connect to my pc i can't deal with.
i don't do spotify or subscription i download and store it like an ipod.
i grabbed an s25 after the pixel 7.
it's the perfect phone imo in terms of size shape.
had that one.
the only complaint i'd say was the atrocious battery life.
i enjoyed the two lg phones i had.
i'm just bummed out that my g2 didn't last.
it was a great phone when it worked.
that's good to hear glad it's working well.
i had a nokia lumia and i enjoyed it but the lack of play store really sucked and forced me to switch to an android.
yeah i hear the 9 series is very solid.
i'm excited to see what a tsmc made tensor chip is going to do for the pixel 10 series.
i hate that mine went bad so quickly.
i could imagine keeping that phone for at least 2-3 years if it didn't.
i liked that phone.
man that's crazy smh
i guess i just got extremely unlucky.
it was my first iphone as i always had android.
i was kinda slightly peer pressured by my family and partially curious how iphone was.
and then i have thoughts on going back to iphone
but then i remember its keyboard
and then i don't want it anymore.
"its that bad... unless its free, probably won't get another iphone."
it's amazing how much better phones have gotten over the years.
i kinda wish they went back to that to an extent.
it definitely was unique.
i'm looking to upgrade to the pixel 11 series next year hopefully.
this time i want to go with the pro xl variant.
i look forward to the tsmc made tensor chips.
i'm excited about the upcoming pixel 10 series.
but i think i'm gonna hold out another year
i really missed out.
i think i remember seeing it in the verizon store at the time too but for the life of me i don't know why i didn't choose it.
wish i could go back and tell my 2014 self to pick that phone over the lg g2 i had at the time
yeah it made it more memorable for sure.
"yeah i agree, i'm a lighter user but i've noticed the battery life on my pixel 7 isn't as good as the 2xl was."
but it's certainly not the worst i had.
i'm looking to upgrade to the pixel 11 pro xl next year hopefully.
i want to go with the xl model this time because i want a bigger display and battery.
i'm also looking forward to having a tsmc made tensor chip too.
i think that will be a big improvement in terms of efficiency.
i appreciate your insight man.
this is good information.
i completely agree with everything you said.
this is why i never was interested in owning any of xiaomi's phones but i've always been curious about them.
i'm glad oneplus phones are interesting to me as well.
i'm a pixel user but i'm looking to get the oneplus buds 3 one day.
man i'm so sorry to hear you had such a bad experience.
i currently have a pixel 7 which i've had for almost 3 years and it's been great
but i want to upgrade next year to the 11 pro xl hopefully.
dang man that's crazy
upon further thinking i have to change my answer to iphone 15 pro.
it's another janky piece of shit.
the damn thing gets hot to the touch after only a few minutes of running not resource-intensive apps unlike the se it lacks a 3.5mm jack therefore it is exponentially worse
apple is a very conservative company.
"they're not known for pushing the envelope too much, but they wait until things are out for a while then use it later to ensure it works properly."
i understand their approach even if i don't like apple as a company.
my wife has the 13 and it's been stable for her.
but i just never could get into iphones.
i don't mind ipads but when it comes to mobile i prefer android
"samsung galaxy s3, s4, s5 nokia 5 and nokia 8 5g. the first one broke destroyed batteries yearly."
the other had green tint after half a year.
the 4th and 5th were just horribly slow and had no camera stabilizer
that's totally fair.
"i appreciate you sharing your thoughts on this, my friend."
i enjoy talking about this stuff lol
thank you for sharing i'm really curious now about asus phones.
i heard the zenphone 10 was a good phone
but i know that's more recent.
also xiaomi phones aren't available in my country either.
glad the redmi phone has been great for you
that's good to hear.
i've always been curious about huawei phones
man that's awful
thank you for sharing
i totally feel you on that.
ironically my very first touchscreen device was the original ipod touch i got my freshman year of college fall 2009 but i didn't get a smartphone until the summer going into my sophomore year july 2010 and it wasn't an iphone it was the lg ally 3g. i've been a lifelong android user
so i've always preferred android over ios when it comes to mobile.
"but i do have an ipad 10th gen that i like to use around the house for media consumption, light gaming, and the occasional zoom calls, but that's about it."
never heard of it thank you for sharing.
that would drive me crazy
man that's impressive i heard great things about oneplus
but i never owned one.
"however, i'm curious about them."
my current phone is the pixel 7 which i've had since launch.
it's been pretty solid for me for almost 3 years now.
this is my 2nd pixel device.
the first one was my beloved pixel 2xl which i got in late 2017 and had all the way up until the release of the pixel 7 in 2022.
that phone worked flawlessly the whole time i had it.
"the only thing i didn't like about it was the screen, which was too dim in direct sunlight."
"but other than that, i didn't have a single issue with that phone."
it made me a pixel fan for the foreseeable future.
"the pixel 7 is better in terms of the screen and the cameras, but the fingerprint scanner is a bit disappointing as it can be really inconsistent at times."
"but otherwise, the phone has performed well for me so far."
i plan to keep it for another year and then upgrade to the pixel 11 series next year hopefully.
"that's totally fair, i get that."
the only things i don't like about the pixel 7 are the fingerprint scanner and sometimes the battery life isn't the best.
i'm looking to upgrade to the pixel 11 series next year hopefully.
i'm excited to finally have a tsmc made tensor chip and an ultrasonic fingerprint scanner.
i also want a bigger display this time around
so i'm going to go with the pro xl model next time.
ohh ok gotcha.
what's the rokr
that's really surprising because doesn't that phone have like 12 gb of ram that's crazy
man that sounds miserable
i've always been curious about oneplus phones.
i didn't even know they existed until the oneplus 3 series.
that was the same year i started really paying attention to the phone industry.
i like what they are doing with their hardware.
i'm planning to get the oneplus buds 3 or whatever the next generation is.
when nexus phones were around i wasn't paying much attention and i really wish i did.
i hear how they were some of the best phones around at the time.
what is your current phone
"hopefully it will hold out until you can upgrade, my friend."
that's totally fair.
i know everyone prioritizes different things when it comes to their phones.
"for me i'm not a gamer or a heavy user, but for me i place a high value on software experience and good battery life the latter is something google needs to continue to work on of course, but when it comes to the software i haven't found anything better on the android side of things i'm looking to upgrade from my current pixel 7 to possibly the 11 series next year because i'm looking forward to the tsmc made tensor chips moving forward."
"i'm not expecting a huge boost in power, but i do hope there are big gains in efficiency."
how is the software experience on honor phones i've never used any of them since they aren't sold in my country.
"that's totally fair, thank you for sharing."
this is good to know.
i'm not very familiar with mediatek's chips because there aren't a lot of phones that are sold here in the us that include them.
thank you for sharing your thoughts on this.
what did you switch to afterwards are there preferred brands you like now i'm a lifelong android user and i've had two early motorola phones and 2 lg phones.
the lg ally 3g verizon was my very first smartphone and it was a fun model.
i only had it for a year but it was a great introduction to android for me.
next i had the motorola droid bionic from 2011-2012.
i remember it having pretty good battery life for the time and it was a decent phone.
but unfortunately i cracked the screen when it fell from my pocket on concrete.
"the verizon store didn't have a replacement model so they gave me the droid razr instead and it was ok at first but about a few months in, the battery life was horrible and the processor became super slow and laggy after a year with it."
the bluetooth also stopped working and it was just a miserable experience near the end of my time with it.
the lg g2 is the phone i went to next
and it was a great phone when it worked.
"but 8 months in, the screen glitched out like crazy to the point it became unusable."
sadly that was my last lg phone...
"well technically the pixel 2xl is an lg phone since they manufactured it lol, but i don't count that"
my wife has the 13 which she got in late 2023.
that's a decent amount of time.
thank you for sharing lol
this is why i'm not interested in foldable or flip phones at the moment.
they just don't seem to be very durable and that terrifies me.
but i understand the appeal of them though.
thank you so much for sharing i'm a lifelong android user but i only had one samsung phone and that was the s6 which i had for 2 years.
it was a good phone and remember the camera was actually really good for its time.
also that the first phone where the processor stayed pretty snappy throughout my time with it.
the only issue i had with it was the abysmal battery life.
it's gross misrepresentation for sure.
makes me angry.
man that's horrible
i'm sorry that happened.
did you move on to another phone
man that's crazy.
thank you for sharing i'm a lifelong android user but i remember at one point wanting to try windows os.
i honestly wish they would've survived so that way we had a third major os to compete with ios and android.
i think competition is good.
"i actually prefer it over the s25 ultra, although i do like the shape of the s25 ultra more."
thank you for sharing.
i've never owned an iphone.
the only two apple products i've ever owned were the og iphone touch ironically my very first touchscreen device and my current 10th gen ipad which i like to use around the house.
i don't mind ios when it comes to the ipad
"but when it comes to phones, i'm team android all the way."
man that's crazy.
i never had a oneplus phone before but i've always been curious about them.
what did you go to afterwards
thank you for sharing your experience on this.
that's very fascinating.
very few reviewers even mention it.
"i am used to iphone, xperia 5 series etc so for me ultra phones are huge."
"basically, my rule, however stupid it is, i want to be able to sit down with the phone in my pocket."
did you know you can still order replacement batteries for this and swapping them out for a fresh charged one made ot tolerable.
i still use my v20 as my backup phone.
"i even bought a battery that came with its own back cover because it had the huge capacity of 10,000mah."
can't get them easily any more.
yeah i completely understand that.
"it's really unfortunate how people automatically assume iphones are better because the majority of people here in the us have them, when that's not even true."
i don't mind ios when it comes to the ipad but for mobile i'm definitely all about android.
the only way i'd ever get an iphone is if i was given one as a secondary device.
yeah i think i'm going to follow your lead and i'm going to wait for the 11 and let them iron out any issues with switching to tsmc and also there's not really much of an upgrade if you do do it each year you definitely have to give a couple years to get any kind of difference.
we can still get the hint off that time from youtube videos but offcourse using them was fun.
don't worry u already have nice tech these days it's just we are so accustomed to all these features now to the point that we don't enjoy them because every phone has almost same stuff going on as mobile phone technology has reach to the point where its just a phone camera and social media stuff.. everything feels bland and boring these days as there is no new features to explore left.
ai etc are just novel features.
i remember back then phones used to deploy special buttons for quick fb or social media access directly on the phone eg htc chacha..as social media were starting to take off.
i need to qualify my statements to say that xiaomi does market segmentation so the same model may have different hardware and different network support depending on the region.
so chineseindian models are cheap but have poor network support for euna.
the 'global' models typically have much better network bands and nowadays seem to cover almost all the network bands needed for t-mobile.
problem is us networks still need their own carrier specific updates for voltevowifi support which the 'global'and chinaindia xiaomi phones still have problems with.
"i remember tech odyssey which is a youtuber i follow, made several videos regarding the heating issues of the 15 pro."
i know that was the first generation where apple started using titanium instead of aluminum or stainless steel rails.
not sure if that has anything to do with it.
has it been that way the whole time for you
well yea kinda but it puts a lot od hype over some things that are or old or usles to users that live normal life
i think the recent phones are much better.
the phone i used had an intel chip too.
it wasn't very optimized for anything lol.
now i use a samsung a56
switched from the iphone right to an s7 and it was cheaper too but really good.
and then to my favorite phone of all time the s10.
but why ipad i got the tab s7.
it's pretty old now
but it's really good for media consumption and also it comes with a free spen so can mess around in notes and art as well and has quickshare so yea.
"meaning, all of them."
the first phone that let you put music on it.
"it was limited to 128mb, pretty poor considering i had a mp3 disc player since 2001"
"ya i was surprised too its all software, the hardware is fully capable"
once i got a call and screen hot hanged.
"didn't know who was calling, i had earphones connected so i picked it up with my earphone button."
i was talking to my gf before that
"so i assumed it's her and said ""hi baby"""
but it turned out to be my mom .
after that i got redmi note 3
hate to say it but current phone is an iphone 15 pro max.
"i miss android, but the apps on my apple watch ultra are legit vs when i left android a few years ago."
i've got schlage deadbolts on the front and back door that i can tap the watch on and it will unlock.
with or without the phone being on me.
it does a great job of tracking runs and bike rides too.
"i really like it, i much prefer it over the pixels software"
yeah honestly the old school flip phones were the best
and i miss those.
but yeah i don't think they're worth it
i went back to iphone.
microsoft got to the phone game too late.
"then only marketing their phones to business users, was a bad decision."
"oh, that's another one recently i was looking for a tablet to read books in a new language i'm learning."
"i have an e-reader, but it gets really annoying, really fast when you have to often check words in the dictionary due to how unresponsive e-paper is."
"i was looking at ipad they were within the budget, but then i learned software i would need was paid on ios."
as opposed to free on android and windows.
"i went a bit outside of my budget and settled for 14"" 2-in-1 windows laptop..."
"it's a bit too big, but functional."
"just to clarify, i mean the software is actually free and open source lol, not that i can pirate it.,"
at 150 it was still better.
i've been loyal to the pixel since though
definitely learned something new.
i appreciate you sharing your insight on this.
the cheapest way to fix my 13 pro max is to replace the motherboard which is 200 on aliexpress.
but then i see carriers like total wireless give you a free 13 if you get a 3 month plan for 150 or other carriers have the s24 for 199 and s25 for 399 for new customers
and i would only have to wait a maximum of 6 months for them to unlock.
it doesn't make sense spending money on fixing an old phone when you can get a brand new one with insurance if you choose.
i honestly wish we could return to more physical buttons on the side on the sides of phones for more functionality.
i like the tactile feeling of buttons.
the squeeze to assist feature and the physical back fingerprint scanner that were on my beloved pixel 2xl were awesome.
"yeah the side frame is made from titanium mine's been overheating easily from the first day i got it, and my model was made a few months later than models from launch so i would think the issue would be resolved then but apparently not"
"no, i completely agree with you it is a bit annoying when iphone users act like some features are completely new when all along i had it on my pixels and galaxy phones for years lol"
yeah that makes sense.
i heard the intel chips weren't good for mobile.
especially their modems.
how would you compare samsung and xiaomi phones lineup to lineup
yeah the s8-s10 generations of galaxy s phones were peak samsung to me.
i've only had one samsung galaxy and that was the s6
then i switched to my beloved pixel 2xl back on black friday 2017 and had it all the way up to october 2022.
that phone made me a pixel fan for the foreseeable future.
i now have the pixel 7 which i got at launch and it's been solid for me for almost 3 years now.
i plan to get the pixel watch 4 this fall and upgrade to the pixel 11 pro xl next year hopefully.
the only reason i got the ipad was because my wife and i got a good deal on them at best buy when she needed to get her macbook fixed.
i don't use it for productivity
but i actually enjoy having it around the house.
"however, that's really the only ios device i don't mind having lol."
"otherwise, it's android all the way for me"
that's super interesting thank you for sharing
that would be the final straw for me too lol dang man that's crazy.
"unfortunately being in the us, i never had any experience with any xiaomi phones since they aren't sold here."
that's totally fair and understandable.
it's all about using what works best for us.
no shame in that.
thank you for sharing i'm really curious about magicos now.
thank you for sharing
yeah it's very unfortunate
that's completely understandable.
thank you for sharing i always think these types of conversations are fun to have.
i'm so happy to see so many pixel users on here.
where i live i barely see them around.
although since the pixel 6 series i have seen more of them around than i used to.
i've been a pixel guy ever since owning my beloved pixel 2xl which i upgraded from my old galaxy s6 to.
i had that phone for 5 years and it was the best phone i ever owned.
it remained flawless performance wise the entire time i had it.
i upgraded to my current pixel 7 at launch and it's been solid for me for almost 3 years now.
i look forward to upgrading next year to the pixel 11 series hopefully.
i completely agree.
i think that's the better route.
man i'm so sorry to hear that
i like samsung just because of less bloated and 6 year of os updates
"i'm in the us and all my phones come straight out of china because i want true flagships , i can't allow myself to charge my phone overnight , or sit charging it for an hour or more , got used to charging at 80-240w and the rest seems so early 2000s makes no sense."
"same as cameras , all mainstream brands are ripping us off , they recycle camera hardware from year after year like it is ok."
"i pay the price for a flagship to be a flagship , not to use the same tech as last year or the year before that ,"
"if you do get an honor phone, don't get one of the budget devices because it may not give you as good of an experience, i'd recommend the magic 6 pro, magic 7 pro or honor 400 pro"
that makes sense.
i've only had one samsung galaxy device and that was the s6 but that was before the one ui days.
i switched to my beloved pixel 2xl which i had for 5 years until upgrading to my current pixel 7 which i've had since launch.
i've been team pixel ever since.
but i always stay curious of other phones because i'm a phone nerd lol.
"thank you again for sharing your experience, my friend"
oneplus from their beginning.
i like the hobby element.
also hi-res audio.
"i'm deep into the google ecosystem drive, photos, calendar, gmail, contacts, etc."
"thus, the pixel is the best fit for my use case."
i started out with apple but didn't like how little it could be customized.
i'm sticking with it because it runs the best version of software that i use every time i drive highway radar which connects my radar detector via bluetooth.
they were the only company that gave me a complete phone with everything i wanted.
then it's a tie between sony and vivo.
"sony for always keeping the legacy features i love, and vivo for the insane camera tech and ir blaster."
subjective i know but redmagic
"good price, love their gestures, no preloaded crap."
"i tried using apple, was missing too much stuff that i was used to."
whoever does the job best for me at the time of buying.
i'm not blindly loyal to any company.
"decisions are based on what i want from a phone, prior performance and experience with their products as a whole."
"i'll come in with preferences, but the final decision is influenced by those things"
all time sony ericsson
blackberry and sony.
"i always loved blackberry, and i always thought sony made the coolest android alternatives to samsunglghtc back when those were the big 'droid makers."
"i haven't owned a blackberry in well over a decade, and never owned a sony android."
but always wanted one.
"out of phones i've owned recently, i'd have to say apple."
"i love the software, features, and cameras."
mostly because i've been using iphones since 2010 so i prefer sticking to something im familiar with.
"i use my phone strictly for calls, texting, and browsing so i don't need the extra features android os has."
i daily an iphone 15 pro
and i do have a sony xperia as my work phone since i think having 2 of a similar phone is weird
and it's cool to have both os's on hand.
samsung xcover because they have removable batteries.
i've had several phones with dead batteries and it's e waste.
an absolute disgrace it's disgusting that most phones don't have easily replaceable batteries.
i'm assuming it's consumers fault for wanting thinner phones.
now sony due to user friendliness and comfort eg headphone jack
i base preference on the phone and price.
oneplus has been great recently.
"i avoid apple due to their ecosystem, price, and lack of user freedom."
"i like a few different brands for various reasons, but for my personal devices i prefer oneplus and for business i prefer pixel."
motorola makes a good alternative for either.
brand loyalty is for suckers.
"xiaomi, at least on my country."
they give more techs for lesser price.
samsung and google make the best android phones.
i've just loved the brand since the walkman series.
it's the only brand right now that provides sd card and 3.5mm headphone jack on its flagship phones at the moment.
also just like the simplicity.
"also loved the form factor, which was ditched this series"
"during start of smartphone era, i prefer apple, but then i like samsung, until near end of last decade i start to prefer more oneplus and xiaomi, until present day."
i have and do really enjoy using google devices.
"but, i have been using samsung lately because they are also great"
and they always give great deals.
"i have an iphone for work, and it's okay, but i don't necessarily enjoy using it"
oneplus since the oneplus one was my entrance into the smartphone world
"motorola for good hardware and good prices, tv out samsung for the software, cmaras, tv out."
i value tv out as an emulation nut
photography and practical features.
samsung's note range.
for obvious reasons.
apple to socially fit in and oneplus for offering such good phones for a lower price.
"tariffs will ruin it, though."
i've bought 3 different honor branded phones since 2015.
"the first 2 phones i bought, they were owned by huawei in the 2010s, and my latest phone is from the independent company."
you get a lot of bang for your buck with the pixel phones.
solid hardware and updates.
i prefer samsung but you're going to pay top dollar for them vs google.
apple for security.
huawei but currently using a samsung
oneplus for sure.
their last 2 phones are near perfect and they keep improving them every year while keeping their strengths
"sony, if they sold it here."
huawei because of the innovation and how strong huawei is.
"imagine samsung got this ban, surely they couldn't survive like huawei survived."
samsung all the way.
apple is everything that's wrong with big tech.
so i've had many different androids before but samsung is just far better than the rest.
their hardware tends to be at the cutting edge but most importantly samsung's software is just the best.
everything from their ai tools to their built-in spam blocker hiya just rocks.
one ui is the best android layer out there and unlike the chinese brands samsung's close google partnership means everything google phones have is also on samsung phones.
with samsung you have two major tech powerhouses covering every base you could ever want covered on your device.
"unless something big changes, i won't be looking elsewhere again."
oneplus for speed and stability even several years after purchase.
"samsung, i used samsung galaxy s6 then switched to lg, oneplus and recently xiaomi poco all flagships, but almost all phones disappointed me."
"some lg, xiaomi software and oneplus hardware issues."
now switched to s24 ultra
and i'll never looked to anyother brand again.
i was die hard htc really miss them went samsung and google after that now have a red magic 9 pro
"apple and google, because those smartphones are reference"
samsung becuase i buy midrangers.
"samsung gives good gorilla glass protection, prompt and solid update policies."
eg a56 that's it
"pixel, decent camera graphene os."
"although next il be tempted by oneplus or nothing phone, although now that pixel does a 'normal' size pro that will be hard to ignore."
"i used to love xiaomi, then huawei now it's apple."
huawei will forever be my biggest love though.
the p9 pro was sensational
"despite what's happening lately, it's samsung, mainly because my first phone was a samsung phone, and my first android device was also a samsung, and i've gotten more accustomed to it"
google and apple for different reasons.
apple for health tracking and google for os features.
"so, i have both."
i was all apple loved the apple se's models size until i got a pixel 9a.....
price was 200 new.
top notch camera oled screen.
i cant tell the difference if its apple or google. feels the same.
i'm not fan of any particular brand.
"now when i look back, i think i'm someone who buys products primarily for their value for money."
"i had nokia 6300, sony xperia x10, sony xperia z ultra, mi max 3, oneplus 8 pro, oppo find x5, and now vivo x100pro."
"if there's one brand i had a soft spot for, ten years ago, it would be sony."
sony xperia is my sentimental favourite but the google pixel 6 was probably the best all-around phone i ever used.
xiaomi doing something which others can only dream
i've went through a lot of phones and i've settled mostly on oneplus.
"i've had the 6t, 7t, 8t, 12, and 13."
"i also tried the 11 but returned it in favor of the pixel 7 pro. speaking of which, i've really tried to love pixels but i have problems with almost every single one."
i'd prefer pixel for the more open nature and day one updates.
oneplus isn't far behind on updates though.
i also gave samsung a fair try with the s24 and s24 ultra.
"they can't capture active shots like my kids, especially playing sports."
i don't care how great dex is or how many accessories are available if a 1200ish phone can't take a clear picture.
i'm in the us sooo that's just about my only options.
i won't do iphones due to lack of user control like no user accessible file system.
motorola would be great
i really like the thinkphone look
but they're behind on their cameras and software updates.
"was a samsung premium phone user for the decade, got frustrated with the prices, tried one plus 12, am a total convert to one plus"
you can't escape google.
whoever or whatever you use.
"to make life easier, i choose pixel."
asus people just ignore their rog phone because they think it is a gaming phone.
"but if you see otherwise it has best processor best camera best display, best haptics and so on and battery as well."
it is the only android phone that i can say is a complete package and can compete neck to neck with apple.
"i always have been an iphone guy, recently i really started liking androids, and also recently i broke my 12 pro max and had to use a 6s, holy shit i liked that 6s lol, it so convenient in size and buttons and everything i love that."
"as a brand its hard to say, because i really dont agree with many software and pricing stuff that apple does."
"my android fav is samsung but samsung also makes some shit that bothers me to hell, like the constant copying, for example the watch ultra which isnt only a bad temu copy of the apple watch ultra"
"but it also has horrendous software, its just oof, also why the f is the charging speed not up to the competitors yet."
xiaomi and its subbrands make some cool shit
but they also looove to copy which just looks very very bad sometimes and unoriginal.
"google is okay in my eyes, i dont have favorites or beefs to pick with them."
"i had a huawei once and kinda liked that, the camera was peak, but recently they really aint doin it for me without google."
"honor and nothing are in a cathegory for me where they do some stuff that i like, for example honor's camera can surprise me and i like nothing's originalness in its os, but also some stuff that i dont like for example honor's software aint my fav and so is not nothing's outer phone design and cameras."
"so after reading all this lol i wont pick a fav for now, you guys comment and if a new phone comes out from somewhere thats from a good brand hit me up"
"oneplus, for experience, affordable and never failed me"
my preferred brand is google.
"every couple years, i'll venture out and try something else like samsung, oneplus, iphone, and honestly they're all perfectly fine and each has something that they do better than the other...but, within a couple months, i always end up going back to a pixel phone."
"i like their ui, no bloat, and pixel-exclusive features like call screening."
"also, while there are other phones out there that might have better cameras in different lighting, the pixel's camera always takes acceptable pictures."
been using oneplus exclusively since the 3t. hard to beat from a bang for your buck perspective.
"google pixel, it just works"
xperia series from sony
the deals are too good
so i upgrade every year.
got the oneplus 13 16gb ram 512gb rom and the oneplus watch 2 for 387 usd after a trade in and early preorder.
"i bought pixel because i thought ""well, i'm used to google's services, why not try their hardware"" i was switching from samsung and what i really liked about the pixel is it's software."
"it is buttery smooth, looks clean and fresh."
"also cameras are amazing, both photo and video, but every flagship today is in the same level kinda, so the cameras are not the selling point anymore"
"but i like the fact that all 3 modules are 50 mp, neither samsung nor apple give you that i'm positive that you can buy something better for that money in terms of camera and software from chinese brands, but i don't think it will be as good as the pixel outside of china"
"samsung, ultra easy to use, customizable, classy, inexpensive, the photo quality is there depending on the range."
"works for a long time, they only get better with time, and the design of the phone becomes more and more attractive"
"after using phones from all major brands, i prefer samsung for now."
"minimal design, not bad software, good hardware, and too many features."
been using nexuspixel phones since i got away from the old sidekick phones in the early 2000s.
"tried samsung, hated it, and immediately came back to google."
"i don't need bloatware, and pure android is the best os imo"
i can go with any brand as long as it's not mainland chinese.
currently my daily driver is an iphone 16 and my backup phone is a galaxy a33.
"i have used lg, sony, hmd's phones in the past too."
"just wish they had better software, but when it works, it works beautifully."
also headphone jack.
"motorola, the last 4 smartphones i used were of motorola."
currently using moto edge 30 .
great customization 3. love their characte in general
i can't pick a favourite.
i currently have a xiaomi 14 because of its size and camera quality.
the os is shit though.
on the other hand i owned an asus zenfone 9
"and i loved it, superb clean and fast software , side mounted fingerprint scanner dead fast with scrolling function, the cameras were bad."
"no phone company makes a compact phone with outstanding hardware and software for me, so i prioritise the hardwares hence i always end up picking xiaomi that has great value for what it packs."
their foldable hardware is honestly a step above everbody else although oppo seems to have caught up this generation.
i'm using a global honor magic v2 in the us and it is just the best.
even their software is pretty great these days.
i got android 15 back in january the first non-pixel foldable to get it.
"i dumped a bunch of sand into my hinge by mistake and after washing it out even though the phone is not ip rated and openingclosing a bunch, back to normal."
that was back in june of last year and phone has been flawless since.
no case and device looks like new still.
hopefully the tarrifs don't ruin my chances of picking up an honor magic v5 later this year
"they're usually reliable, i like the ui, the customization and smooth connectivity it has with my other samsung devices."
i like nokia.
it was my first phone back in 1996one of those classic models with the small screen and real buttons.
"it was simple, strong, and just worked."
"no touchscreens or fancy stuff, but it lasted forever and never gave me problems."
"even now, i've been using nokia phones again for the past 5 years."
it's been super reliable.
"no crashes, no weird bugs, and the battery easily lasts a full day."
"i don't need a fancy camera or tons of featuresi just want a phone that's stable and does what i need, and nokia does that really well."
"i did use an iphone in the past, but i had issues."
"it looked nice, but it felt like i had to take care of it all the time."
"with nokia, i don't have to worryit just works, and that's what i value most."
i've been using iphones since 2008 and will stick with them.
i've been using their phones for the last 12 years or so.
"nexus 4, pixel 2xl, 6 pro got stolen recently and now the 9 pro. among these, the 6 pro was my favorite."
"i loved huawei before they banned native gms, my p30 pro was the goat, such an amazing phone for it's time, still takes photos better than my wife's iphone 16"
"apple, samsung, oppo, oneplus, google"
camera ui bugs
anything but apple.
been using mainly sony for some decade.
google because of relatively clean interface.
switched to pixel 8 for this reason after my nokia 8.1 died.
google. has everything plus the integration is seamless.
i also if i have to choose would rather not use apple vs google in the battle of oligarch monopolies
google pixel for me.
i've dabbled with more or less every brand of other phones before settling on iphone for the last 8 or 9 years.
"i then went pixel 7 propixel 8 proiphone 16 pro max - because i thought i missed the apple eco system, but having a mix of android and osx really wasn't that big a deal."
after owning the 16 pro max for 6 months i've realised that it's not as good even as the pixel 8 pro.
my pixel 9 pro xl arrives tomorrow
and i couldn't be happier.
forever and always.
"there are a lot of reasons, honestly, but the chief among them is that they are the keepers of the sacred flame of 3.5mm."
"i've had a great 4yr run with my nokia xr20, but i'm thinking of moving to a google pixel, for its 7 years of updates and other unique security features - come this year's the next black friday sales."
these days its the google pixel.
the first couple smart phones were blackberries though
and then i went to the samsung galaxy for a couple generations.
they were all amazing
"nokia, the last phone i used from them was nokia 6.1 2018 worked great for 5 years, the software was clean there were no ads or unwanted applications installed, everything was good just the battery was 3000mah which was not enough and it was also ending on it's life cycle so had to switch to a xiaomi redmi note 12, this phone is good too but too much pre-installed apps, ads popups, unstable updates etc. nokia will be my pick again if they create more phones in android category."
google pixel i have an 8 pro
google pixels and samsungs.
"reason being is that i'm deep into the google ecosystem and use everything in it that i can, aside from a few things i don't limit myself exclusively to that ecosystem, so naturally the pixel works best for me."
"i also love the software and how clean it is, and the cameras."
samsungs because imo they're second best to google and since they have a close partnership with them
i decided that if a pixel phone wasn't good enough for me then a samsung surely would be.
vivooppo for having the best camera systems out there.
used to be motorola until lenovo decided to give 0 fucks about customers.
now it's google for the same reason motorola was my choice no bloatware and therefore good performance.
"i like redmagic phones because there good at gaming and have advanced features and i like oneplus phones for there simplicity, power, and waterproofness"
and i like google pixel phones for their many updates for example my google my 4 year old google pixel 6 is still getting updates and the new google pixel 9 will get 7 years of updates and i like samsung phones for their features simplicity and customizability
always had a soft spot for them.
"and now that there isn't a brant other than zte that doesn't put a hole in my screen for the selfie camera, sony has become my preferred by default."
"it doesn't hurt that sony also has one of the best camera systems and displays on the market, not to mention top tier audio quality from their 3.5mm jack for all of my wired headphones lying around."
sony deserves my vote because everyone else has abandoned me.
my preferred phone brand is xiaomi for the insane value for the price and sony for their unique cameras that don't use too much processing and gives a lot of control to the user.
it just works like it should with no laggy performance or random errors.
samsung because of the smart tags they are bad imo and the long software support.
"also there are some nice features but for that premium pricepoint i was expecting more now have the s23, otherwise i always had 200 chinese phones which died after the warranty expires"
vivo x200 pro mini
"i'd love another huawei over anything else, but i can't be bothered with all the micro ggbox stuff to get some apps to work."
i don't really stick with a brand - i just pick whatever phone seems to be the best dealoption for me at that point in time.
"when i craved a smaller flagship i went with a base s20, now i wanted bigger and got a oneplus 13."
the only hill i'm willing to die on is not switching back to apple.
"used to have iphones as work phones, but i just never could get used to the osecosystem."
"i've used android a lot more and longer, so i know it inside out - no reason for me to switch os."
samsung and apple.
just thought about trying nothing but that will have to wait.
"one plus, as the stereo speakers are bloody brilliant, i'm on my one plus 8 pro now, which also has 12gb ram, wireless charging and it's a little bit slimmer or wide as other phones and it also has high res audio, and i'm a musician so thsts important to me, they are literally the best speakers audio through the headphones i've ever heard, listening to dnb as i write this and it's very good, very good bass, , the cameras are good but i never really care about cameras as i'm not taking selfies all day and thinking other people might want to see, it's got a camera and thsts good enough for me"
the phone manufacturer that will sell me what i want.
"expandable atorage via micro sd, wireless charging, decent processing, water resistance, and a price that isn't absurdly high due to greed."
i don't give an f what company that is.
"i've dailied phones from apple, samsung, motorola, htc, google, palmhp, lg, and blackberry."
google is my go-to brand.
"i've had the pixel 3, 3xl, 4a 5g, 7, 8, and 9 pro. default android is the way to go imo, and their cameras and ai features are unmatched."
"phone i love oneplus, camera samsung, video sony.."
"if op would get a solid camera and money was no object carrier deals make samsung, google, or iphone the phones of choice i would pick op over everyone.."
"samsung and google, we're limited in the states."
"my first android was the htc evo, and one of my all time favorites was the moto turbo with the kevlar back, that was before motorola was bought by lenovo."
"i used to be a die hard samsung fan in the earlier years when they allowed bootloader unlocks, etc but then knox came and made things tons harder.same thing for the pixels, you have to pay your phone off in order for you to get the ""oem unlock"" option to show upso"
i completely gave up.
"customizing android isn't fun like it used to be, but it's still somewhat appealing i've gotten older i'm 30 lol"
and i want things to just work nowso i transitioned again over to the apple ecosystem.
"the phones are supported for a decent timeit's pretty, the cameras are amazing but the 14 and 15 kinda went a tad downhill organized and not fragmented like android."
but everything over here is subscription based and it's quite annoying and sad.
"customization is getting better for sure, especially being able to set default apps, but ios still feels slightly locked down."
"and maybe that's okay, becausesecurity i like to believe this lie too."
i try not to store sensitive info in icloud and i have photos sync off.
edited for ios support times.
the only ones that have decent enough security for grapheneos.
bought a pixel 8 last years.
"samsung or apple, apple made the most recent compact phone, and i like the additional features samsung phones bring to android."
"apple and pixel, they have small phones"
not loyal to any of them.
"i have a pixel 9 pro, iphone 16 and s25 ultra."
love them all for different reasons.
mine are samsung and asus.
i have great experiences with some of their products and the aftersales service is easy to find.
"samsung personally, mainly because i been with them for years and i'm so use to oneui and picking up a pixel before actually felt lackluster compared to what samsung has built in along with good lock."
though while samsung features i do miss i am trying out iphone for a bit but might end up switching back to samsung idk yet
samsung and motorola samsung for all the features that they stick in their phones.
people would think google would modify the software better because they own it but they don't.
motorola because i get the most bang for the buck buying a 2 year old version of their phones.
when i was using ios i used to fall back on motorola to do all my android task cheaply.
"switched from a pixel 7 pro recently to xiaomi 15 ultra, the camera module was leaps and bounds ahead."
i do not think i have any brand loyalty per se.
"when elite 3 gets released downstream will see which one has better camera module - could be vivo, might be xiaomi again, or something else."
"oneplus 13, can unlock bootloader, can root, the vibration experience is currently the best, the battery life is also good, and the camera is at the forefront level"
"motorola, inexpensive and close to vanilla android"
"apple, i love the simplicity of it and how well it pairs with their other tech."
although with the apple intelligence scandal it's beginning to sway me but i'm still here.
apple has the most security features of all
"and it's also convenient to use iphones, since it's one of the most common phones out there, everything is optimised well for ios."
apple cos of better optimization of apps and games...plus videos are better on ios and samsung just the ultra series cos of its boxy design and have always like one ui and the freedom of customization it brings..especially after one ui7 and good lick cant even imagine going back to other device n outdoor photos are great on samsung have been buying each s series and iphone from the start... change both device each year currently on s25 ultra as primary and ip 16 pm as secondary
"xiomi due to custom rom support, sadly that has changed and i am onto no fixed brand now"
they just good.
"i love the camera quality in social media, i love they're security systems, they're pretty stabile in price, so then you can sell it for good amount, and i think that apple prefers quality over quantity."
"2. samsung s series- classic, pretty good, but worse than apple in quality."
"for example- i have samsung s21 for 2 years, it's getting hot, and one day the back fall of, i had to glued them back."
all phone brands with colorsrealmeosoxygenos-the reason they give the best specs for the money and never disappoint.
motorla and tcl the best stock android experience and also really good specs for the money honor-camera
i started my smartphone journey with the nokia lumia 720
and then the 950 xl.
"as windows phones saw their downfall, i moved to google."
i started with 2xl and 3xl and am now holding 7 pro.
the main reason for shifting to a pixel is the clean android experience.
"that said, this may be my last google pixel phone, as i see that the pixel drops are becoming less interesting for older devices."
1 year into using a one plus daily....
the hype is real
i like particular models each year and that's it.
"brand loyalty is dumb, i dislike them all equally."
dont like it much.
wana switch but can not decide.
google or samsung
"fluidity, apple walletcard, native apps and services"
been using it since 2014 as my daily driver.
"not a gamer and don't have any social media apps installed aside from reddit, so i primarily use it mostly for work related stuff and entertainment like spotify and netflix."
"i don't have the time anymore to tinker with phones like i used to way back when i was still using android phones, and i like the support it gets in terms of security and updates even when the product is already eol."
but i don't upgrade quite often.
i'm still using an ip13 since it's released and the performance is still top notch with 88 battery health left.
"while its far from perfect, i really like the fact that they are one of the few manufacturers making a truly compact flagship."
"software side of it works great for me, since i like to have a good amount of customization so oneui is perfect for me in that regard."
"the first-party ecosystem is not bad either i'm currently using a s24, watch7, buds3 pro, tab s9 and am planning to get a laptop from them soon, as well."
"as a bonus, the accessory selection is only second to iphone i also tried a pixel fairly recently - while the overall experience was really good, it was just a bit too basic for my liking."
loved the cameras though
"samsung, purely for one ui and things like stackable widgets which you can't get on any other android brand"
"huawei, my huawei mate 20 pro is durable af it's such a shame there's no gms on newer type, so for next phone i just bought vivo x200 instead i heard good thing about vivo, hope it could last forever my huawei mate still works till now, i use it as 2nd phone"
"samsung for sure because of well established after sales service and software experience, specially after one ui 7"
sony...most unique phones with stock android.
"rn motorola, edge series."
fantastic curved displays and very good ui with extra moto apps like smart connect and unplugged.
sleek and elegant designs and turbo fast charging the only issue for many is the late software delivery which i personally don't mind at all cuz we receive them in any case.
great job motorola team
i was a samsung stan for the longest time now i won't buy anything but a google pixel.
used to be an apple fanboy but now samsung all day
"i use extensively for slack, emails, browsing, texting."
"i really appreciate that my macbook, ipad and iphone are always synced and i can continue wherever i want."
facetime with my parents.
"i am not into too much customization, so it's been great."
siri is pretty useless but very good at adding to my todo list and keeping timers.
xiaomi something something im broke
"no preference, whichever puts the best camera on a phone at the time of purchasing....so that will never include iphone, pixel or galaxy phones."
"currently xiaomi 14 ultra but had honor, huawei, sony, htc going back through the years"
"vivo, then oppo, then samsung, then honor."
i currently have an honor phone.
samsung lacks memory 128 to 256 gb in midrange and honor lacks os polish and reliability.
"vivo is usually good all around, while oppo should have more care for their selfie optics, usually weaker than the competition."
their os itself is enough for me to never go back to samsungxiaomi or apple
"apple, i've always used their phones so i'm just used to it, but most phones are good these days"
"huawei originally, their software was just so stable, my mate 9 never crashed or froze up."
i still miss that in every phone i've had since.
"oppo x2 pro, customisation with coloros was great."
everything just worked.
"easy to use and set up, really loved the vegan leather back."
the camera was a bit but screen quality was good.
"google for their cameras, had my pixel 8 pro four months, but just couldn't get on with it."
"calls kept dropping, couldn't often connect to the wifi or 4g and the amount of times the phone crashed, i had to reboot the phone four times in about two hours."
i've shortlisted two phones i'm next hoping to try honor magic 7 pro or oppo find x8 pro.
"weird kinks, undercooked software, and shitty company aside, the fact of the matter remains that they still provide one of if not the best hardware packages of any flagship phone in the market."
"i've been fortunate so far that the sum total of my issues with sony don't actively ruin the phone or make my life worse too, so until they make phones, or until someone with a better grasp of software releases a phone with the same hardware features, i'm gonna stick with them."
"i don't select tech by brand, but the most priceperformance hardware they offer for the money i have at the time."
"i have used huawei, oneplus currently using 8t, samsung, sony, xiaomi in the past."
i find brand loyal communities to be superficial and toxic in regards to people who hop between brands when they shouldn't care what someone does with their money.
i have an honor.
wife has an apple and had a samsung before.
she wishes she picked an honor instead.
i had a huawei before and it was leagues ahead of its time.
honor is sort of like a sister brand to huawei that has google services
so i went with that.
"the battery charging and camera is ahead of the competition, but not as much as huawei is."
anyone remember siemens they were affordable and very cool.
motorola fan here.
best value for money in midrange phones.
my edge 30 neo was extremely snappy and fast with its snapdragon 695.
"been a pixel user since last friday, but already considering switch to samsung otherwise my least favorite brand, havent had a samsung since 2013 after looking at s25."
"i wanted to try oneplus, but their phones are heavy as brick."
"xiaomi i dont bother, the os looks like some childrens play game interface."
i really enjoyed my motorola droids.
had a pixel 3a and loved it.
moved to iphone and happy with what i have.
no preferences as i've enjoyed both.
oneplus as of right now.
i have the oneplus 13
and i like what they're doing especially at that price - beating samsungs25u in almost everything while still being around 300 cheaperand even cheaper if you buy it from a site that's based in chinatradingshenzen in my caselike i did.
"i would definitely put oppo and vivo up there, since they might beprobably are better than oneplus, but are less accessible and available internationally."
"samsung for a cell phone because when i first got a cell phone it was an android, so every time i get a new phone i do stay with samsung phones because i like the system."
"also, i do have apple devices, because there are apps that are really cool that are available with apple."
mine is samsung i love the ecosystem they're creating.
"i know they are a bit behind apple on this, but i think they keep working on it and the development is noticeable."
"also, they offer a wide range of devices unlike other brands, and they seem to be the ones who have the most developed ecosystem on android."
"in my opinion, they offer a great balance between different features, a great range of devices to have and user experience as in you don't need to know a lot about programminginformatics to have nice things."
my favourite phone ever is the oppo find x2.
"i still have it,but it has screen burn."
"i replaced it with an iphone 16 pro max, wish i hadn't."
i'm just used to it now and using any android feels weird.
"plus, i own a macbook, an apple watch, an ipad, and i love how seamlessly they work together."
"most of my friends and family have iphones as well, and while we use whatsapp and instagram here, using airdrop is so convenient."
i don't need to customize everything.
i really prefer an os where i feel i don't need to change much and that's what ios is to me.
"i still can use the google and microsoft apps i need, the camera is good in any situation including low light, moving objects and videos, and the in-app camera in social media apps preserves the image quality i want."
the number of third party accessories is so much bigger.
"i have found great third party apps that suit my needs, some of them are ios exclusives or simply work better on ios."
"after sales service is better, at least in my country, and specially out of warranty service, while paid, it's easy to find authorized providers compared to other brands."
"the phone will hold its value for longer when i ever decide to upgrade, and i can use it for years knowing i get the latest software updates in the same day as everyone else, regardless of the model."
so many of the default apps work amazing and are nice to use.
the snapdragon versions.
"samsung, with google in very close second"
used to be samsung then xiaomi now vivo
"xiaomi, too many useful functions"
complete ecosystem in the country i live in.
"runs android, oneui"
samsung it used to be google.
but pixel 4 really turned me off.
messenger would have issues.
my first samsung was an s22u
and i love the camera.
i had pixel 2 cl to 4xl
and when i got to 4 it was really bad.
"for me it is xiaomi, reasonable price with a good specs."
"i've started with flagship killer like mi 10t pro, and now using an actual flagship like xiaomi 15."
"some may say xiaomi ui is suck, it is but doable for me."
i was sony.
then i was samsung.
then i became oneplus now i'm iphone
1. samsung - most refined software and featurescustomization via goodlock.
software is so good i'm willing to overlook trash battery because of it 2.
"oneplus - best hardware at least in us great battery and fast charging 67-80w, 2 things my samsung phones lack despite their great software."
oneplus also has my 2nd fav software.
cameras good could be better.
3. apple - gold apple watch and apple credit card if it wasn't for the 2 things i wouldn't use iphone
but they get the job done.
4. motorola - always made great phones just lackluster support.
decent amount of features and offers fast charging 45-68w.
5. google - i like pixels but haven't had one since the pixel 7 because of lack of features.
at this point stock android has even less customization than ios.
great call screening and voice dictation.
don't really use photo editing but heard it's great too.
"6. xiaomi - honorable mention, hadn't used one in about 5 years because it only works with one carrier for me mint mobile, but their redmipoco phones were my go to before i could afford flagships."
"apple, because the battery lasts much longer than all my previous android phones."
plus its a lot less bloatware than all the chinese ones.
before huawei got fucked i would've never thought of switching to samsung
currently samsung just because i currently own one in mid range tier and probably this is my most amazing possession that actually helps me in my day to day life.
samsung but cant afford it anymore.
"thats why im using redmi note since 2020,and it sucks."
i don't keep a prefered brand because brand loyalty is not good.
i only get phone which gives the most value for money for the price after research
huawei best for the look and also its capability and photography.
removing gms from them is for a reason.
do think about it.
but apple to brag and show off.
i actually have an iphone 15 pro maxgifted at work and also a huawei p40 prousing since 2020
xiaomi and its not even really close.
they along with oppo are really the only ones that actually innovate year in and year out instead of releasing the same product year after year with minor differences.
but i have also never used a bad xiaomi product even beyond their phones.
"tablets, earbuds, appliances they are all good products."
but i do use a google pixel for work and there is a lot i like about it.
i usually recommend the pixel a series to most people.
i just wish google's more expensive phones had much better qc and weren't so far behind in some areas like their horrid modems and charging situation that seems stuck in 2019.
would choose oneplus if they had an spen like samsung does
apple and samsung
"from the premium phones i have used g pro2, p30 pro, s22u and now 16pm, the worst is s22u by far and favorite one is p30"
"i use iphone now, but always loved sony, but sony is shit in software update even now."
"back in the old days, when og pixel came out, whoever own a pixel will get first hand on android update."
while others have to wait in line for the their respective brand developer to build that update for them.
i don't think that's the case anymore.
but sony still is shitty in that department.
while most brand are focusing on 5 - 7 years software update.
sony is still stuck in the slow ass update and old mindset.
but the android skin is love to me.
"its less bloat, and doesnt feel to much skin like xiaomi."
it felt like nothing os in a way.
iphone cos of durability
"samsung, habit is the reason, i assume that any other brand of android smart phones are just as good."
"i am on samsung snote series for a while now, i think at least 13 years."
"switched back and forth between note and s, but after having it all, landed on smallest s series phones, which is now more than capable of doing everything that i need."
"why samsung i don't know honestly, but since i am in europe, not all phones were available with the major carriers."
wanted to try oneplus but never decided to give out that much money for a phone.
carrier renewed my contract every two years and with it gave me a huge discount on the phone.
stayed with one carrier throughout that period and basically the choice was then samsung or apple.
"in their defence, their s lines are excellent."
i've resold every phone after two years for 2-3x what i paid for it.
"camera is good, battery is usually inside those two years good."
never had any major issues besides their own cpu.
"fairly easy to transfer to a new phone, know where are things despite small changes."
like the design and the size.
"been using a huawei phone lately, and i'm honestly impressed."
the battery lasts forever and the camera's surprisingly good.
samsung the a or s even m fz
i just like the variety of it tools they implement in the phones
"i used to love my sony phones, the form factor, expandable storage and the headphones jack are just great, but they're too expensive now."
"pixel if you like photography and quirky google features bixby otherwise to me, apple is like the toyota of phone."
they implement tech once it becomes proven and desireable.
they don't rush to innovate.
it just works.
"you buy into the 'ecosystem' i now own a prius, 4runner, and plan on getting a gr corolla and eventually a nicer 4runner."
"orange, because of tim cookjobs"
has to be samsung for me
but it's complicated.
i've had a lot of brands but i won't mention the ones which no longer exist.
my first smart phone was the iphone and i was apple until the 4s.
i then switched to android and fell in love with the ability to customise the hell out of my phone
so i knew i'd never go back to iphone i was samsung from the s7 edge until the s23 plus but wanted to go stock android for a while
so the pixel 9 pro xl was the phone to push me to make the switch.
love the stock android experience... didn't so much love the hardware after so many years with the speed and reliability of samsung.
"needless to say, the pixel issues became too much after six months and i went back to samsung, now on the s25 plus."
i can ot fault samsung and their hardware.
"they really know how to build a solid device and on that front, they're up there with apple."
the pixel definitely has the edge when it comes to software if you want a clean and seamless experience.
but i'm afraid i don't think think their hardware or durability is quite there yet.
"i haven't yet owned two phones from the same brand unless we consider pre-smartphones, in which case i've had three samsungs now, but based on the experience i have had - huawei some cheap circa 2012 phone was pretty impressive for the price."
"though also, was my first smartphone so it was going to impress me no matter what."
replaced because i wanted something fancier.
"- samsung galaxy s3, exynos version amazing phone."
only replaced because it got old.
- meizu m3 note adequate.
"nothing special, did the job."
"replaced in the end because the charger port wore out, after earlier replacing it with the next one on this list as an ""upgrade"" but quickly switching back."
- blackview p10000 pro extremely impressive battery.
"literally everything else about it sucked ass - couldn't reliably connect to mobile networks, was sluggish, camera wasn't particularly great."
ended up getting rid of it and going back to the meizu.
- xiaomi redmi note 7 adequate.
ads in system apps were quite annoying.
"otherwise, was good value for the price."
also replaced because the charger port wore out.
"- oppo a94 5g very solid device, no complaints."
replaced due to update end-of-life.
"- apple iphone 12 also very solid device, but a lot of the minor differences from android still irritate me a bit even after 6 months of using it."
"in particular i love how apple pay just works, every time, unlike google pay which was always a bit of a hassle."
"i would not have purchased an iphone, but i won one in a contest and had it sitting in a drawer planning to sell it, then when i realised i needed a new phone, i was like ""screw it, let's just use that one""."
"if i was buying a new phone now, it'd be a toss-up between oppo and samsung."
"i'm probably not buying another one until my current one either breaks or is no longer supported for updates though, and i think that's still quite a while off for this model."
i always buy motorola.
long battery life.
not much bloatware.
the glass seems indestructible.
i'm on my third phone in maybe 10 years
"and i have never chipped or broken the glass, even though i've dropped them a bunch of times."
they are good enough for me.
i don't know if the cameras are as good as others but i don't care because i don't take many pictures and never take selfies.
but i recently switched to s25 ultra
and im loving it.
still preffer apple over samaung but for now im sticking with ultra line
"xiaomi, they are improving every year with some great specs and have stopped from just making budget phones with minimal specs"
"apple, because i just don't care about all the fancy features and like longevity."
all my iphones served me well for at least 5 years before i even considered to upgrade.
"samsung, try my wife's iphone from time to time and just hate the rudimentary software and lack of customisation."
she loves it.
"tried a few other androids over the yearssony, lg and xiaomi but come back to samsung s phones usually base models."
"software is exemplary, great customisation through goodlock and all designed to work perfectly on their devices."
dex system is amazing to run a desktop mode from phone wireless or wired.
the devices peaked with s9 and note 9 as still had sd card support and headphone jack.
but hard to beat battery life gains with s25 snapdragon elite.
my sons had a series phones and they also held up well over a few years.
had many other smartphone brands over the years even iphone and samsung has by far been my favorite
and i have been sold on them ever since.
seemed like all my smartphone issues stopped when i got my first samsung which was a note 5.
i don't foresee that ever changing either.
lg. because they made good phones for much lower prices.
they stuck to their principles and offered value and useful innovation.
i miss them.
samdung ended up just copying iphoney since or after the galaxy s6 and that was the end of me ever considering that brand.
"if xioami or huawei came to the us, i'd jump on their phones in a heartbeat."
the phones we have in the us are complete crap.
"every year, there's less and less to choose from, less and less features, and i'm convinced that these major players are corning the market here to prevent competition."
"asus, motorola and sony used to have good presence in the us but not anymore."
"all we have is garbage from samdung, crapple, goober pixel, and oneminus."
basically cookie cutter phones with all features stripped out of them.
sorry for my rant but someone had to say it.
redmi budget smartphones work for 4-5 yrs easily.
custom roms are gem hardware is very easily available for cameras google pixel but lots of bugs and heating issues.
"it used to be htc, now its samsung because ... whatever."
i have samsung note 5 mobile.
you tube app is not supported at this phone.
any reason or remedy.
i really miss my sony phone.
i had the xperia 3 x3 whichever the last one verizon offered was.
switched to motorola when they dropped sony.
now i have a pixel 8pro.
which i love.
but i'd love to have a new sony phone more than anything
"samsung, but working there creates an obvious bias"
"well, it's one of the chinese brands where you can get a flagship phone that is on a par with samsung s variants."
"plus it's 10x cheaper as an asian, buying cheaper saves more money than buying an expensive phone that breaks after 1 drop like an iphone."
"oneplus, innovation, cost for high performance with fantastic battery life and charging speeds."
no need to have battery life ptsd when it charges so fast.
wide variety of first party accessories that all work very well.
"their earbuds are phenomenal, charging options are incredible, cases are simple and effective and all very affordable without sacrificing a lot."
been with them for years and plan on sticking around.
"a long while ago it was motorola, then google, then oneplus before they became crap and when google released the hot garbage that was the pixel 4."
now it's back to google.
all that to say probably google.
i just like the pixel experience.
they're good phones other than the aforementioned pixel 4.
"i love my old umidigi, lasted longer than any of my other phones."
motorola stock android.
comes with charger and protective case.
my g75 even came with a pair of moto buds.
"unpopular opinion, but nokia hmd."
they haven't made me switch to another brand because of the exceptional durability and irresistible prices for our region.
"pixel ui on non-tensor hardware, unlocked bootloaders on demand and simpler end-user repairs are additional bonuses."
i usually go for phones that offer reliable performance without burning a hole in my pocket.
"what matters most to me is a clean experience ,good screen, dependable battery, and no unnecessary bloat."
that's why i am exploring new devices.
"recently have come across v3 series from alcatel, its really good phone with decent specs."
"they got the basics right, and provides great display along with ai integrated performance."
"something that just works, keeps up with my day, and doesn't feel like a compromise."
i've always loved honor and also i have no idea why i just think it's a really polished and clean yet quite not known yet.
like a hidden gem
samsung it's because i love the over the horizon ringtones is excellent for me
i only have brands i would never again buy myself - huawei and apple.
"lg and nokia windows phones, blackberry, lg env3."
current brands probably apple and google.
windows phone was great at the time just needed more apps.
i miss physical keyboards on phones like blackberry or the env3
"first had it during 4s time and it was easy to navigate, and good for basic usage, communication and games."
i dont do anything else w my phone.
and icloud as well.
have years and years of stuff in there.
so will just stick w iphone.
"good for video, playing game and texting."
"4s, 6, 7p, xsm, 12pm, 14pm, 16pm"
iphone since nothing can compare.
i would be a huge oneplus fan if the customer service was worth a damn.
"i had several times i had to contact support in regards to my 7 pro and 9 pro, and every single instance was either not resolved in one contact or just impossible for them to resolve."
i couldn't get them to send a correct quote for having my 7 pro back glass and battery replaced.
i talked to 5 agents and got 5 quotes all wrong none of them included the battery.
"with 9 pro, i pre-ordered but their preorder bonus was out of stock."
"the next day, i saw they had a different preorder bonus."
i contacted support and was told unless i wanted to cancel i couldn't get my preorder bonus.
"with my 9 pro, i broke the display."
contacted support told them by order number and i had broken the display.
i had paid for device protection at checkout.
they had me send my phone to oneplus directly instead of their insurance partner.
i had to have it returned and start all over with their insurance partner.
"so they can sell their insurance partners services directly at checkout and they can take their cut, but they can't do the bare minimum when it comes time to use the services they make money by selling"
could you elaborate what you mean by 'hobby' here thanks
they're one of the few phone companies i can actually see making drastic improvements over the years.
i love one plus hardware but the changemerge from oxygen os to colour is took away a lot of things i like about the software
"i had oneplus 12 last year, this year got the oppo find x8 standard - audio quality is much better on the oppo - both for the speakers and for the in ear earphones."
can you elaborate on the hires audio
oneplus is spying on u change to iphone or samsung
"i loved the camera on my pixel 2 xl, but man i had to rma it 3 times."
"screen burn in after i lock the phone and the screen turns off, the display flashes white usb port failure"
what advantages do you get for those apps on a pixel compared to any other android phone
but all the things you listed can be done on any android phone.
also deep in the google ecosystem and have been for maybe a decade or more.
"however, it's samsung for me despite owning three pixel generations, including the very first one when they were practically unheard of."
far more reliable and that little more refined i find.
"deep inside i'm a pixel fanboy, but i just can't compromise unfortunately."
"you don't need a google phone for that, just an android."
"pixels heat up, have a weak battery and noticeably weaker range than, for example, oneplus."
"they should be the benchmark for an ideal android phone, ... but they aren't."
what radar do you use and is the app made for your rada than waze
blackberry torch was honestly one of the best phones i ever had.
thank you for sharing i wish blackberry was still around.
we need a third major mobile os
i have the 9 pro
is red magic a part of xiaomi i'm aware of them but not very familiar with them since they aren't sold in my country
motorola is good.
i haven't had any of their phones since the droid bionic and original droid razr 2011-2012 but i really like what they are doing these days with their hardware.
i just wish they supported their devices longer.
"but otherwise, solid phones."
its a pity motorola has not marketed themselves as good.
"their pricing has been good, they are any day better than their counterpart category xiaomi, realme etc."
"i have good memories from motorola in the software department, i used midranges and everything worked almost flawless."
"now, their quality control was always pretty bad."
specially related to screens.
the last one i tried on a daily basis partner and sister had the moto g60 were a big disappointment in every possible way.
i don't know if things have gotten better since they moved to amoled.
are there stutters glitches bugs in the software.
that's totally understandable and fair.
thank you for sharing your thoughts on this.
"same, i do some research and see what is bestfits my needs best."
"i had htc, sony, lg and oneplus i bought used phones for my last few generations and used samsung phones are usually way overpriced."
"sorry, i should've clarified, i meant out of the companies that are still around today."
but yes sony ericson phones were legendary.
i honestly wish blackberry and windows phones were still around so that way we had 2 additional options when it comes to mobile software.
"i'm a lifelong android user and i never had blackberry or ios, but i've always respected them for what they bring to the table.."
my work used blackberry till covid
dude started so strong then said he owns an iphone .
i've just bought a pixel 8a for myself.
it will arrive tomorrow.
i'm a bit anxious as i've never used a google or any other brand phone really - i've only used sony xperias.
that's totally understandable.
thank you for sharing
i lowkey want to switch to sony
but they don't sell the phones in my country korea and b i introduced someone i knew to their now wife and they now work at samsung electronics
so i get free phones like once every 2 years and i can't argue with free tbh.
i'm moving to the us for a few years soon and my current phone is about 2 years old and so switching to a sony is really high on my list of considerations tbh
i like their hardware i wish they were sold here in the us still
oneplus phones seem really solid.
i never had one
but i like what they are doing with their hardware.
"these are solid choices if the pixel didn't exist, then oneplus would definitely be my primary phone followed by samsung or motorola."
unfortunately being here in the us i never had any experience with xiaomi phones since they aren't sold here but they seem like solid phones
thank you for sharing your thoughts on this.
i'm a google pixel guy myself.
i like samsung's hardware though.
what drew you to oneplus and xiaomi phones i'm pretty familiar with oneplus
but i have no experience with xiaomi phones since they aren't sold here.
thank you for sharing
not a bad company oneplus is pretty solid.
i like what they're doing with their hardware.
i'm thinking about getting the oneplus buds one day
that's totally understandable.
thank you for sharing
i love google's software approach the best.
both of your statements are so sad to me.
but thank you for sharing
i hear great things about honor phones.
they aren't sold here in the us unfortunately.
how long do they typically support their devices
"same started 2015, bought 5 so far."
"but i am not so happy with the independent brand, was besltter with huawei."
google in my opinion just needs to continue to hone in on their hardware.
"they are my preferred phones, but i always call them out for the things they need to work on."
"that being said, i never had any issues with the two pixel phones i've owned so far pixel 2xl which i had for 5 years and my current pixel 7 which i've had for almost 3 years now."
"google's software is what has me hooked on pixels due to its clean software and consistent updates, it really keeps them running smooth and fluid for years and years."
at least in my experience.
that's totally fair.
great points thank you so much for sharing
i like what oneplus does with their hardware.
the galaxy s6 was the only samsung smartphone i've ever owned.
i remember it having a really good camera for the time and the software was actually pretty snappy for a touchwiz device.
i had it for two years before switching to my beloved pixel 2xl
and i've been team pixel ever since.
i'm now on my 2nd pixel device and i just can't over how great the software is.
yeah it's really unfortunate how htc and lg went away
that's not a bad way of looking at it.
thank you for sharing your thoughts
that's totally understandable.
fair point thank you for sharing your thoughts on this.
i never got a chance to try huawei phones when they were available here in the us.
"xiaomi phones were never sold here so i never had any experience with any of their products, but i hear good things about them."
which iphone do you have now
that's totally fair.
my first ever phone pre-smartphone era was a samsung flip phone back in 2004.
the only other samsung phone i had was the galaxy s6.
that's a nice combo
i've been a pixel fan since owning my beloved pixel 2xl which i had for 5 years before upgrading to my current pixel 7 which i got at launch.
the clean software and the frequent and consistent software updates are what really makes me a fan of google phones.
that's totally fait.
thank you for sharing your thoughts on this.
i never got a chance to try any of the sony phones when they were available here in the us.
i heard great things about them hardware wise.
xiaomi phones aren't sold in my country
so i unfortunately never had any exposure to them.
but i hear great things about them.
i appreciate you sharing your thoughts on this i completely understand where you're coming from.
i really like what oneplus is doing with their hardware.
i totally agree with you regarding motorola.
they have fantastic hardware but the lack of consistent software updates is really holding them back for me.
if the pixels didn't exist oneplus would be my number one choice followed closely by samsung only due to the support.
i wish oneplus phones were fully supported on all us carriers.
i prefer the pixel because of the timely and consistent software support and its clean os.
i've had two pixel phones so far my beloved pixel 2xl
and my current pixel 7 and both of them have remained solid for years.
these are the first phones i've owned that i didn't experience any slowdowns whatsoever after years of owning them.
the only thing google really needs to improve on is their hardware.
i just want them to continue to work on the efficiency and power output of the tensor chips.
"despite this, i haven't had any issues with performance over time."
at least in my experience.
i really like what oneplus is doing with their hardware they seem to be really solid.
i am in the same boat.
is the os a lot different and does it take long getting used to are there things you miss
google for the win
i've always been intrigued with asus as a company and i want to learn more about their phones.
what is their software policy like how long do they typically support their devices
"hey my friend, i truly appreciate you sharing your thoughts on this."
i've never been an iphone person but i definitely respect them for what they bring to the table.
one of my favorite iphones of all time is the 8 plus.
i think it's the best of the home button era of iphones.
"i also really like the 13 pro max, that's easily one of the best phones apple has ever made."
it's just a really solid iphone in all regards.
"unfortunately i haven't had any experience with xiaomi, huawei, or honor phones since they aren't sold here in the us."
"i'm a lifelong android user my first smartphone was in july 2010 so i've had 2 lg phones lg ally 3g, and lg g2 , 2 motorola phones droid bionic and droid razr , and 1 samsung phone galaxy s6 but since switching to my beloved google pixel 2xl back in the day, i've been hooked on pixel devices."
what i loved about pixel phones is google's software approach.
"it's clean, quick, and very well supported."
"their hardware isn't as powerful as samsung or apple, but man the software really shines and it keeps the phone performing beautifully for years and years."
"i had my pixel 2 xl for 5 years and it remained flawless the whole time i had it, i now have had my current pixel 7 since launch and it's still solid almost 3 years later."
i love what google does with their software.
they just need to continue to improve their hardware in my opinion.
i really like what oneplus is doing with their hardware.
that would be my first choice if the pixel phones weren't a thing.
i'm thinking about getting the oneplus buds
thank you for sharing your thoughts on this i've been a google pixel fan since owning my beloved pixel 2xl which i had for 5 years before trading it in for my current pixel 7 at launch.
both phones have been phenomenal for me.
oneplus is definitely something i'm interested in.
i love what they are doing with their hardware.
if the pixel didn't exist then the oneplus followed closely by samsung galaxy s series phones would definitely be my phone of choice.
i'm planning on getting the pixel watch 3xl or 4xl as well as the oneplus buds soon.
i can attest to this
i've always wanted to try a sony phone.
unfortunately they are no longer sold here in the us
i like sony products.
those are fire
i really like what oneplus is doing with their hardware.
i'm thinking about getting the oneplus buds one day.
i totally feel you on that.
"ever since owning my beloved pixel 2xl which was my first pixel phone, the software is what made me fall in love with pixel devices."
i like how you get timely and consistent software updates and how clean the os is.
i know other phones may have better hardware but the software of the pixel phones to me is top notch.
thank you so much for sharing your thoughts on this
that's totally understandable
i'm totally with you on that my first google phone was my beloved pixel 2xl which i had for 5 years before upgrading to my current pixel 7
and it worked flawlessly the whole time i had it.
this was the first experience i've had with a phone whose software remained smooth and snappy as day 1.
so far my pixel 7 has been pretty solid for almost 3 years now.
no hiccups whatsoever.
i love the clean software of pixel phones as well as the timely and consistent updates.
thank you for sharing my very first smartphone was an lg ally 3g verizon way back in 2010.
i also had one other lg phone which was the lg g2.
i wish they were still around for competition sake.
"they had some innovative phones for sure, but they just couldn't be consistent in their vision or their marketing."
sony is one of the few brands i definitely wouldn't mind trying if they were available again here in my country.
motorola is doing great things with their hardware i like what they have to offer.
i only wish they supported their devices longer.
"but for the price point, i really can't complain too much about them."
thank you for sharing
that's totally fair and understandable.
i don't have any experience with xiaomi phones since they aren't sold in my region.
but for some reason i've always been interested in asus and what they have to offer.
they seem like pretty solid phones.
i hear great things about honor.
i wish they were officially sold here in the us.
i like what they are doing with their hardware.
"i've seen magic os, but i'm not very familiar with it."
what is their software update policy like on their phones
that's totally fair.
thank you for sharing
thank you so much for sharing your thoughts on this.
i had a nokia flip phone back in 2007-2009 and i absolutely loved that phone.
this was one of my last phones before getting my very first smartphone in the summer of 2010.
"glad nokia phones are still serving you well, my friend"
that's totally fair.
what was your favorite iphone so far
i absolutely loved my pixel 2xl.
that phone was responsible for making me a pixel fan.
i had that phone for 5 years and it worked flawlessly the whole time i had it.
i upgraded to the pixel 7 which i got a launch
and it's been solid for me for almost 3 years now.
i'm sorry to hear that happened to your 6 pro
the p30 was legendary
i personally haven't experienced many bugs with my pixel phones my beloved 2xl and my current p7 but i know many have.
i wish sony phones were still available here in the us
same my beloved pixel 2xl which was my first google phone is what made me a pixel fan.
i prefer pixels due to the software.
i'm with you in that.
i really like google's software approach.
thank you for sharing your thoughts on this i've been hooked on pixels since owning my beloved pixel 2xl which i had for 5 years before upgrading to my current pixel 7 at launch.
both phones have been fantastic software and performance wise.
the software is what caused me to become a fan.
i'm looking to upgrade to either the pixel 10 pro xl later this year or wait until the 11 series comes out next year.
so far my pixel 7 has been rock solid for me.
"i just want a bigger display, an ultrasonic fingerprint scanner, and a more efficient chipset and modem for my next phone."
i haven't had one in years.
"but from what i've seen, they basically make pro level digital cameras that can also make phone calls and connect wirelessly to the internet."
and i'm down for that.
that's a fair point.
i've been a pixel fan since owning my beloved pixel 2xl.
the biggest reason is due to the frequent and consistent software updates.
i also like google's software approach.
i'm on my second pixel now pixel 7 which i've had since launch and it's been nothing but solid for me so far.
i'm looking to upgrade possibly next year when the 11 series comes out.
thank you for sharing i never had a chance to try any of the blackberry phones as i didn't get my first smartphone until summer 2010 going into my sophomore year of college.
"by the time i became familiar with smartphones, blackberry was already on its way out sadly."
but i do wish they or windows phones were still around.
we need a third major mobile os around
that's totally fair.
i never had any experience with xiaomi phones since they aren't sold in my country.
but i hear great things about them hardware wise.
i currently have the pixel 7.
i've had it since launch and it's been solid for me so far.
i plan to upgrade either to the 10 pro xl later this year or the 11 pro xl next year.
i like what they do with their hardware.
"if the pixel phones didn't exist, then oneplus followed closely by samsung galaxy s series phones would be my primary choice."
i'm with you regarding the google ecosystem and the clean software of the pixel phones.
this is why i've become a pixel fan since owning my beloved pixel 2xl which i had for 5 years.
i now have the pixel 7 which i got at launch and it's still rock solid performance wise.
the clean software and the consistent updates keeps it well optimized for years.
i like samsung's hardware better though.
but otherwise the pixel phones are my preference.
i hear a lot about vivo's camera prowess.
"i never had any experiences with vivo, oppo, xiaomi, or huawei phones since they aren't sold in my country, but i hear great things about their hardware."
i only had 2 motorola phones but that was in a different era of the company.
it was the motorola droid bionic and the original droid razr.
i've been team pixel since owning my beloved pixel 2xl which i had for 5 years.
that was the first phone that i kept that long due to how well optimized the software remained over time.
i upgraded to the pixel 7 at launch and almost 3 years later it's still going strong.
i like google's software approach the best.
this is a great list bro thank you so much for sharing your thoughts on this.
i never had any of oneplus products but i'm pretty intrigued by them.
"i'm a pixel guy myself, but i wouldn't mind getting a oneplus phone."
i actually am interested in getting the oneplus buds along with the upcoming pixel watch 4.
i'm looking to either upgrade from my current pixel 7 to the upcoming pixel 10 pro xl this year or wait for the 11 pro xl next year.
so far my pixel 7 has been holding up pretty well
and i've had it for almost 3 years now.
thank you for sharing
those are all fair points.
thank you for sharing
what's your ios version ios 13
thank you for sharing
"nice, thank you for sharing."
gl with that one
"except wireless charging, sony xperia"
samsung and google now support their flagship devices and in the case of google even their midrange devices for 7 years.
google just added two additional years of os support for their 6 and 7 series phones which is awesome but i hear you regarding ios and the lack of fragmentation.
i respect apple for that even if i don't like them.
i respect what they do well.
how well is it holding up i've had my pixel 7 since launch and so it's been rock solid for me so far.
i had my beloved pixel 2xl for 5 years before this phone and it was fantastic.
loved that phone.
i've never used an asus device but i really like what they do with their gaming phones.
prc spyware installed no thanks.
same here ever since owning my beloved pixel 2xl which i had for 5 years i've been hooked on pixels.
i now have the pixel 7 which i've had since launch and it's been rock solid for me for almost 3 years now.
it's pixel for me for the foreseeable future.
that's what's up.
what made you switch
those are all very fair points.
thank you for sharing
nothing wrong with that at all.
unfortunately i can't get xiaomi phones in my country
thank you for sharing your thoughts.
"being in the us i never had any experience with xiaomi, honor, huawei, oppo, sony, or vivo since they aren't sold here."
sony used to back in the day but not anymore
i unfortunately never had the opportunity to try huawei phones when they were available here in the us.
but i hear a lot of great things about them hardware wise.
that's totally understandable.

i've had two pixel phones so far and both of them have been solid for me.
my first pixel was my beloved pixel 2xl which i had for 5 years and it remained flawless performance wise the whole time i had it.
i have had my pixel 7 since launch and almost 3 years later it's still rock solid for me.

i really like sony's hardware.
i wish they were still available in my country.
that's totally fair.
thanks for sharing your thoughts.
i really like what motorola and oneplus is doing with their hardware.
my only knock against motorola is that they don't support their devices very long.
"otherwise, i like what they are doing."
"if the pixel didn't exist then oneplus would be first choice followed closely by samsung's galaxy s series phones, though i prefer the software of oneplus more."
but the pixel phones are my favorite because i really like their software.
that's totally fair.
i've only had two motorola droid phones droid bionic and the originally droid razr.
"i also had two lg phones lg ally 3g which was my very first smartphone, and the lg g2 and 1 samsung phone galaxy s6 but ever since moving to the my beloved pixel 2xl which i had for 5 years before upgrading to my current pixel 7 at launch, i've been hooked on pixel phones."

that's totally fair.
i like samsung's hardware.
thank you for sharing your thoughts on this
i wish they were still available here in the us.
this is a very valid point here.
samsung does seem to do this the best in the android world.
thank you for sharing your thoughts
"i hear great things about oppo, which if i'm not mistaken is the parent company of oneplus i unfortunately never had any experience with oppo phones since they aren't sold here in the us."
but i like what they are doing with their hardware.
that's totally fair.
thank you for sharing your thoughts on this my friend i've never been an iphone person
"but i do have a 10th gen ipad that i love using for media consumption, i also have a macbook that i use for work, but when it comes to mobile i've always preferred android, specifically google pixel phones."
"i understand why people love them, especially here in the us, but they just aren't for me."

thank you sharing
i hear good things about xiaomi's hardware.
never had any experience with any of their phones since they aren't sold in my country.
thank you for sharing
"this is a great list here i never had any experience with xiaomi phones since they aren't sold here in the us, but i hear great things about their hardware."
that's definitely a fair point.
this is why i personally prefer google pixel phones because of the clean software.
it's sad how huawei got banned here in the us.
i never had the chance to try any of their products when they were available here.
thank you for sharing samsung is a pretty well-rounded brand.
i appreciate how they have so many phones available for different price points.
what market are you in xiaomi phones aren't available in my market so i never had any experience with them.
that's totally fair and understandable.
thank you for sharing your thoughts on this.
i unfortunately never had the chance to try huawei phones when they were available here in the us.
but i've heard great things about them.
that's very fair.
"i'm a pixel fan, but i've always called them out for their hardware."
they really need to step it up when it comes to the tensor chip and the modem.
"from what i hear, google is finally ditching samsung for tsmc to make the tensor g5 chip."
i also hear that google is moving to mediatek's flagship modem as well.
i'm really hoping this helps the pixel become more efficient and a little more powerful.
"i'm honestly not expecting a huge power boost, but i do hope for better efficiency."
"if they did, that would be dope"

what issues did you have with the s22 ultra
i never had the opportunity of owning a sony phone when they were sold here in my country but i hear great things about their hardware.
"i've had 2 lg phones, 2 motorola phones, and 1 samsung phone, but none of them were as special as my beloved google pixel 2xl."
that phone changed the game for me and i've been team pixel ever since.
"i'm on my 2nd pixel device now the pixel 7 which i've had since launch, and 3 years later it's been rock solid for me."
i am planning to upgrade either later this year for the pixel 10 pro xl or more likely wait next year for the 11 pro xl.
thank you for sharing
that's totally fair.

samsung is a well-rounded brand for sure.

i recently moved on from my 2010 tacoma which i had for almost a little over 15 years.
it was trouble free.
the only reason i finally got rid of it was because of the axels and wheel joints were too expensive to repair after much wear and tear.
but in terms of the engine and transmission it was bullet proof i know have a 2021 tacoma and plan to keep it for a while and trade it in for a tundra one day hopefully.
i'm toyota for life.
moto fan for life too.
that's totally fair.
i really like what motorola is doing with their hardware.
i only had two motorola phones droid bionic and the droid razr but this of course was in the very early days.
"i'm now a pixel fan myself, but i like motorola's hardware and price points."
i had my z3 for 7 years.
battery life started shitting itself.
then a ceramic plate fell edge first on to my screen.
i mean shattered.
so now i've switched to pixel 8pro because i didn't like any of the motorola phones verizon was offering
that's totally fair.
"thank you for sharing i've always been an android guy when it comes to mobile, but i don't mind the ipad or the macbook."
"i have a 10th gen ipad that i love for streaming, playing casual games, and occassional zoom calls."
thank you for sharing your thoughts
thank you for sharing your thoughts i unfortunately have no experience with xiaomi phones since they aren't available here in my country.
but i hear great things about their hardware.
"that's totally fair, that's how i feel about pixel phones."
they have clean software and are very well supported with updates and seem to perform very well for years and years.
i had my beloved pixel 2xl for 5 years and it remained flawless the whole time i had it.
i didn't have a single issue with that phone.
i only upgraded to my current pixel 7 because google stopped updating it.
"but lately, google is supporting their phones for much longer now"
and i really appreciate that.
my pixel 7 is almost 3 years old and it's been rock solid.
"thank you so much for sharing your thoughts on this, my friend."
i'm a lifelong android user first smartphone was an lg ally 3g verizon
i got back in the summer 2010 going into my sophomore year of college.
"i've had 2 lg phones 2nd being the lg g2, 2 motorola phones droid bionic and droid razr and only 1 samsung phone galaxy s6 but have since settled with google phones with the first being my beloved pixel 2xl."
so i never had an iphone as my daily driver.
"my wife on the other hand is an iphone user and every time i use it, i can't stand how ios navigates."
"i do have a 10th gen ipad which i like for video streaming, casual games, and the occasional zoom calls"
"and i have a macbook that i use for work, but those are the only two apple products that i have."
"but when it comes to mobile, i've always preferred android over ios."
that's totally understandable i've only had one samsung phone and that was the galaxy s6 which i had for two years.
i really liked the hardware and it had a pretty solid camera though this has never been my top priority when it comes to phones because i don't take many pictures.
the only thing that annoyed me about that phone was the battery life near the end of my time with it was atrocious.
i also grew annoyed with some of the duplicate apps that were unnecessary.
i also realize that this was before the oneui days
so i know things are different now.
but otherwise it was a pretty good phone.
i went from that phone to my beloved pixel 2xl and i became a google pixel fan ever since due to their software.
i do like samsungs hardware though.
no need to apologize at all.
i really appreciate you sharing your thoughts on this.
i think topics like this need to be discussed and we as consumers need to be honest with these companies.
i'm a lifelong android user and sadly only had 2 lg phones the lg ally 3g verizon which was my very first smartphone july 2010 and the lg g2 2014 to early 2015.
i really enjoyed those phones.
"unfortunately, my g2 was only great for 8 months."
the screen calibration went absolutely haywire to the point it became unusable.
i got a replacement g2 and sadly the same thing happened about 3 months in.
i was devastated because i really liked that phone.
i never went back with lg after that.
"afterwards, i went with the samsung galaxy s6 which was my only samsung phone."
i had that phone for 2 years before finally settling on google.
the pixel 2xl was the phone that was responsible for making me a pixel fan.
i had that phone for 5 years and it remained flawless for me all 5 years of owning it.
the clean software and frequent and consistent os updates is what keeps me coming back.
"i now have the pixel 7 which i got at launch and almost 3 years later, the os is still smooth and running well with virtually no hiccups."
i do wish lg and htc were still making phones and i wish sony still sold phones in the us.
i never got a chance to try any htc or sony phones where they were available.
i did have two of the early motorola phones droid bionic and the og droid razr though.
this was before i was really informed about the larger phone market.
"knowing what i know now, i definitely would've went htc, sony, and nexus back in the day."
i hear a lot about xiaomi's redmi line.
"unfortunately, being in the us i haven't had any experience with any of their products since they aren't sold here."
it's really sad how htc went away.
i wish they and lg were still around.
i wish had the chance to try sony phones when they were sold here.
i like their hardware.
i've been a pixel user since my beloved pixel 2xl which was my first google phone.
i'm now on my second pixel phone pixel 7 since launch.
lol i completely understand.
thank you for sharing your thoughts on this.
i hear a lot about xiaomi phones but never had any experience with them since they aren't sold in my country.
but i hear great things about their hardware.
i've never been an iphone person.
i don't like ios when it comes to mobile.
"i don't mind the ipad or the macbook, but when it comes to phones i've always preferred android."
i try like what oneplus is doing with their hardware.
"if pixels weren't around, oneplus would be my phone of choice followed closely by the samsung galaxy s series phones."
i'm actually thinking about going for the oneplus buds
"i had 2 motorola phones back in the day, the droid bionic and the original droid razr."
i also had 2 lg phones lg ally 3g which was very first smartphone and the lg g2 and 1 samsung phone galaxy s6 before switching to google.
my beloved pixel 2xl was my introduction to google phones and i've been in love ever since.
i had the 2xl for 5 years before upgrading to my current pixel 7 at launch.
both phones have been fantastic in my experience.
the clean software and frequent updates keep them working great for years.
"this is a brand i never heard of, i'm looking into it now."
thank you for sharing your thoughts how long did you have it as your primary device

i hear a lot of great things about honor's hardware.
i wish they were available here in the us.
i never had any experience with any of their products unfortunately

"i am a bot, and this action was performed automatically."

lol that's totally fair.
i still use my galaxy tab e from 2016 as my alarm clock
"and i really like the ""beginning"" ringtone tone lol"
what was your experience like with those two i'm interested.
i really wish blackberry or windows phones were still around.
it would be great if we had at least 3 major mobile operating systems around.
i've owned so many apple products going back to the early macs but i don't use iphones because of the mediocre bluetooth audio.
i guess we hi-res fans are too small a market for them to be of concern to them.
thank you for sharing
i wish they had us based service.
they did replace my 1st phone after much back and forth.
those weren't really ready for prime time.
i second this.
i returned op10t due to this couple
after purchase and won't be dealing with this company anymore.
every promo they advertised with a purchase didn't work as it was advertised and it was impossible to get any help from customer service.
it felt like they were pulling bait and switch.
"i loved my oneplus 7t. the specs, features and ui for their price was insane."
mine died out out of the blue but my experience with my phone was excellent.
"wanted to buy their newer model but ever since their merge with oppo, the prices rose and the specs dropped."
and oneplus is the leading brand with green lines issues so i had give up on it.
so much to play with in the developer options .
i adjust the audio settings often.
their 1st phone was really a work in progress.
i started with cyanogen os.
it was challenging but fun.
oxygen is more stable.
we haven't gotten colouros in the us.
i'm in california.
i've not seen oppo available here.
i'll give it a look.
audio quality is important for me.
oneplus supports all the hi-res codecs available for me to stream.
apple limits iphones to aac.
it sounds like your phone is defective.
i got my pixel 7 pro at launch and it hasn't given me a day of trouble.
it doesn't even get hot when charging anymore.
i know the 2xl has screen issues which were widely known at the time.
but that was my first pixel phone and the one that made me a pixel fan for the foreseeable future.
i had that phone for 5 years and it remained flawless performance wise the whole time i had it.
the clean software and the consistent updates is what i believe makes pixel phones so smooth and reliable for years and it's why i fell in love with google's software approach.
"i'm now on my 2nd pixel device which is the pixel 7 which i've had since launch and almost 3 years later, it's still rock solid."
"i haven't had any issues with this phone except the fingerprint scanner and sometimes the battery life isn't the best on 5g but otherwise, it's been a great device."
"i am looking forward to upgrading to either the pixel 10 pro xl or the 11 pro xl next year because i want a bigger display, and a more efficient modem and chipset"
i rocked my pixel 2xl for 4 years.
it was a beast... and why i ended back up with a pixel 7 after a oneplus 9
"but is the integration between google apps as seamless on other android devices the phone, contacts and messages apps effectively work as one."
some examples a contact app shortcut can call or message anyone in the contacts app.
the phone app can search for contacts and send messages.
the messages app can search for contacts and make calls.
contact addresses are automatically linked to the maps app.
"the calendar app is automatically linked to the maps, contacts and, google drive apps."
the messages app is automatically linked to the gmail app.
the contacts app is automatically linked to the gmail app.
the phone app can create and add new contacts to the contacts app.
"when it comes to android and not really into gaming, then it mostly boils down to ui, software update and integration and pixel is top tier with these aspects."
"however, it's samsung for me despite owning three pixel generations, including the very first one when they were practically unheard of."
my previous phone was the galaxy s9.
i just dislike their ui design and unnecessary samsung apps taking up storage space.
far more reliable and that little more refined i find.
"fortunately, my pixel experience has be virtually flawless."
"the 120 hz screen is amazing, and the battery life for me is way better than it was with the s9."
"for me, the pixel is perfect because i'm not a power user and the experience thus far has been fantastic."
"pixels heat up, have a weak battery and noticeably weaker range this hasn't been my experience aside from the phone getting very warm which charging which has since been resolved."
"plus, the pixel has a better camera than their biggest android competitors."
uniden r8 tied in with my samsung s23 ultra.
only use waze for directions these days.
highway radar takes the rather thin distance and expands it to whatever you wish.
"i have mine display markings at 12 mile , one mile, 3 miles, 5 miles and ten miles."
waze is limited currently to showing only 12 mile out while my detector has gotten up to a 4 mile warning.
i do keep an r7 in my wife's suv but will switch them out with my r8 when i'm taking a road trip in her suv.
"r7 is good, r8 is just a bit better and that whole bluetooth to my phone."
"four mile warning just took my mx-5 on a shot road trip to to get a soda, 60 miles away."
"sure, my fridge is stocked and there are plenty of places along the way but it is the 130 mile trip that is more interesting i like to drive."
plus my mother in law is visiting... still helped me warn about threats ahead since i generally try to keep around 95 mph avg with both highway radar and my r8 blasting away.
"oh, still ticket free"
no it's a sub brand of nubia
"yeah, that's one of the areas that holds them back."
although i do see more motorola phones in the wild than i see pixel phones.
at least here in the us.
"from time to time, nothing massively annoying."
thank you for sharing your thoughts my friend.
current phones would have to be samsung.
all aspects are top notch.
windows mobile was pretty cool too.
i had one of the pre-touchscreen windows mobile smartphones motorola q9h global and it was unique for sure.
but blackberry was a much better user experience to me.
"oh wow, i didn't know blackberry was still being used by that point."
very interesting indeed.
"iphone may be my current phone, but i've owned phones of every major os over the last 20 years."
i don't owe any one platform my loyalty or hatred.
they've all been great in their own ways.
i'd love to hear your thoughts on the software whenever you get some substantial time with it.
i'm still on the pixel 7 which i've had since launch and it's been solid for me for almost 3 years now.
it's worth it for call screening alone.
sony xperia isn't a brand phone
that doesn't stop me just order from a canadian or european site and then when you get the phone set it for english.
the only gotcha is to make sure that the phone supports the same 5g frequencies as whatever us carrier you are using.
i've been doing this for years - even when sony did sell them in the states because other countries versions of the sony phones had cooler colors.
"they're brilliant phones but i've just had an issue with the oneplus 12 that affected me with the oneplus 8 the screens are so fragile and expensive, drop them once and if you're unlucky they will never work again, with a green line across the screen"
i feel kind of the same way if oneplus didn't exist pixel would be my main phone.
"i'm addicted to the fast chargingbattery life and how customizable the os is on oneplus, but certain pixel features like call screening and hold for me just can't be beat."
plus both brands have the best haptics around imo.
motorola just makes great all-around devices for the price.
"dude, they release their ultra as a global version."
what's stopping you typed on my vivo x200 pro in the usa.
xiaomi phones have their own problems.
it's not worth it in the long run.
"xiaomi have shytty software, one plus is much better for a chinese phone."
"quite similar when i drew to them back then, just currently, in terms of camera, xiaomi has the edge over oneplus, but oneplus bit better in terms of updates if using china coloros rom, that's my personal opinion from using their last year's flagship oneplus 12 and xiaomi 14 ultra, but somehow i don't know, i'm bit incline towards oneplus, maybe because their ai, not saying oneplus get the total victory over xiaomi in terms of ai integration, i'm not hardcore phone user by the way."
7 years for their latest 7 pro line
last lg i had was the g4
the 4k screen of the sony xperia 1 was gorgeous and i loved the 219 aspect ratio.
"couldn't knock the hardware but the camera processing was very poor compared to the equivalent iphone, samsung and pixel phones."
i'm really okay with the tensor chip.
its not a big deal to me that it doesn't hit the benchmarks that snapdragon does.
i just think google should adjust prices for it because that tensor is likely much cheaper than a snapdragon.
i'm on att and my only issue is a lack of wifi calling.
i don't use it
but i would like the option.
us mobile has also launched a service that allows coverage across all three of the big networks.
"i use nova launcher, when i cloned my samsung s24 ultra to my op12, it worked seamlessly the same."
going into settings and making some nice options only made me happy.
"camera is sd superior, battery is amazing"
these days any android phone have at least 4-5 years.
also now there is negligible change in the os.
so even after they stop supporting it can still go 2-3 years more.
yeah google really needs tuning on the hardware lol u know what i like in pixel
"os sometimes it does shit i dont know why or how but its great, like once i was at an airport and my gate number showed up on the always on screen like how did that get there"
but thank you hell
yeah the old xperia models stood out from the crowd.
sadly they don't sell any more in my country as well.
"absolutely, edge series still gets better updates than g series."
however currently i am unsure whether which device to go for as almost all new devices by motorola are with curved display.
i hate it lol
"it's a shame asus didn't keep making compact phones, now they offer nothing interesting or differentiating in the market, just another 6.8"" slab that costs 1000."
and their camera are still not good.
"video stabilization was from another world on zf910, truly obliterating competition."
13 pro max
thank you for the commiserations on losing my 6 pro. and agree with you that the 2xl was superb.
"used it for 5 years, and worked great pretty much for the entirety."
"i'm still rocking my xperia 1 one, but it's showing its age, can't wait for the 7 to be available."
all of those are very true words
"only premium segement phones are good, my phone is just in middle segment and its okay"
but ui is still bad for me as i like clean os.
i am on 18.5 and i am just fine.
"no lags, no bugs."
didn't really say why but i've been a fan of samsung since the original galaxy s device.
"apple, i have the ecosystem and enjoyed early technology."
"i'm starting to like google because of the pixel 9 pro xl, but it's too early to tell."
"you're totally right, i forgot about that will edit."
"it didn't say even an ouch no hangs, saves battery for 12 hours straight working and using battery saver you can use it for about a full day."
"veri nice screen, not bad of a camera but i've seen better on samsung, google ecosystem makes ux much better only problems which i am not bothered are getting hot and not optimized for heavy games 20-30 fps on ultra setting 8n genshin impct."
"i've never used their gaming flagships, only their gaming mid end the zenfone max pro m1."
"imo, one of the best phone in terms of bang for buck at its time."
they are exceptional phones.
excellent hardware and performance.
i also had to switch to a different brand due to the google ban and even with flagship devices i feel they underperfome compared to huawei
just make sure you stick to your guns don't let anyone influence you otherwise.
if you want to be loyal to something then be that's just my generic experience with brands and communities around them lol.
"the thing is average users also dont want to stick to a phone for more than 3,4 years."
"for me i get 3 android major upgrades on a midranger, in my opinion my money has returned the value already."
the bionic and razr were cool phones as well.
i miss my droid maxx. loved that thing.
it was replaced with a motorola z2 play.
wasn't a big fan
but it got the job done.
held on to that until i got the pixel 3a.
was solid right up to when i jumped over to apple.
keep enjoying your pixel 7.
"i didn't know that about oneplus, although it now makes sense as to why the oneplus buds pro 3, are the same as oppo enco x3's ."
thanks for the info.
"forgot the ""why"" part lol i like samsung because of oneui and its customizability."
"i also like the other products, like the galaxy ring, watch, and tablets."
"lastly, the fact that other android accessories like those made by google can work seamlessly with galaxy phones is a huge plus."
"i like google for all the same reasons, but samsung wins for the customizability of oneui through goodlock"
yeah just same with any chinese phones in the us.
great hardware but no repair service as well as limited bands.
if you can live with that and slower updates than googlesamsung though samsung's one ui 7 rollout was terrible i'd give them a chance.
some people have privacy concerns with chinese phones and the information but imo it's probably fine
i had the huawei p20 lite and it was such a good budget phone
azerbaijan where iphone and samsung extremely high.
samsung wasnt always like that in my country.
we use to buy everything samsung.
now they are extremely high that people ignore that its actually exist.
i still love samsung tho lol
pixel is like 90 of the way there.
they just need to focus on the small details and they could be a great manufacturer.
"verizon's selection of motorola sucks, but you can order one direct from motorola for their network."
good to know i am considering giving pixel a try once it's official in my country.
no xiaomi meaning chinese products banned
i believe you can still buy them in the states.
just have to order direct from sony.
which has been my problem.
i'm a poor.
so i'm stuck with whatever options the evil overlords will finance and overcharge me for to lock me into a 3 year contract
i think build quality and software combine currently google apple and samsung are the three that have good overall scores other brands have niche areas that excel but brands need to create products will good overall experiences
the overall hardware is good.
better than some expensive fragile ones.
the software is shit.
my dnd doesn't work properly redmi note 13 and they downgraded my super fast charging to fast charging after updating from android 13 or before the hyper os update.
not all devices are supported when using the blasted ir.
it takes 5-10 minutes to restart it.
the buds 3 and buds pro 3 are incredible.
bass cannons with fantastic auto and the touch controls especially for volume swipe are available on both versions
"i had the original pixel xl, loved it, and when i was considering replacing it, that's when the 4 came out."
that's when i switched to oneplus.
now i'm back to google with the pixel 7 pro and love it.
about 5 years and upgraded because the battery started to get a bit tired and i needed
but it still works well enough for me to use it every day and has a better display than my more recent phone -
it's the umidigi a11 - can't say anything about other versions of the brand but there are many and a lot of reviews.
i prefer it to my more recent phone which is a doogee rugged phone - wouldn't recommend doogee.
"it's not that i would have a bad experience with the huawei, but with the bans in place, i can't see them officially support functions i want."
and apple is just too restrictive and not really that user friendly as opposed to what many apple fans claim.
"windows phone looked so much better than ios and android, easy to use."
the htc 8x was and is my favorite phone.
i know what you mean.
"i've used apple products for years, but honestly, i'm getting tired of them."
"the bluetooth audio on iphones isn't great, especially for those of us who care about high-quality sound."
"these days, i just stick to a nokia phone."
i'm not a big fan of using my phone for everythingi just want something simple that works well for what i need.
they merged colour into oxygen after the 8pro or so.
part of oppo bringing oneplus into its main line or something.
changed a lot of what i considered big qol features.
can't remember exactly now it's been a few years edit i just checked and while they share a codebase the unified os approach was abandoned not long after the initial push
i got my standard pixel 7 at launch as well and it's been rock solid for me so far.
s23 ultra here since pre release.
"those things you mentioned are no longer major issues, though i also shared your same concerns which drove me to google back in 2015 or so with the nexus line ups pre pixel."
pixels are great
and i'd love one again and often find myself wanting to move back
but i just can't.
"95 i thought i was speedster, rip your fuel economy ."
"i had an r7 but it's gone now, not sure how i feel about dumping that much money into a radar again"
but i know it saved my ass a ton.
"odd but what soda requires a 60 mile drive, better give you wings or something"
thank you for educating me on this.
i'll add nubia to the list.
i thought it was nokia misspelt
thanks for sharing
that's very interesting
"wow you just reminded me, i had that phone as well for a while."
i bought an unlocked version and flashed it to cricket mobile and used it for a while before getting a fully touchscreen phone.
"sme here, p7 for almost 3 years."
"it's such a great phone, i haven't really found a reason to switch to a p9"
call screening is that where the phone can label some calls as spam.
"if yes, it might be an android feature rather than a pixel-specific feature, as my old xperia can do the same."
man i'm sorry to hear that
i really like what oneplus is doing with their hardware i'm actually thinking about getting the oneplus buds one day.
i didn't know that that's good to know
is this from a software standpoint
i really like what oneplus is doing with their phones.
the software seems really solid as well.
in fact if the pixel didn't exist oneplus would be my phone of choice followed by samsung
hyper os is trash and bloat that xiaomi has with integrated ads is insufferable.
it's so good to see other android manufacturers supporting their devices longer.
it's a great time to be an android user.
mine was the lg g2.
in fact my very first smartphone was the lg ally 3g verizon back in july 2010
my very first smartphone was the lg ally 3g verizon back in july 2010.
"it had a slide out keyboard and 4 physical buttons on the bottom front of the screen home, back, menu, end call lol."
it was a good phone.
the 2nd and last lg phone
i had was the g2 and i absolutely loved that phone
and it was great....
"until sadly it wasn't... about 8 months into my time with it, the touch screen calibration went absolutely haywire."
it would ghost touch all over the place to the point where it wasn't usable anymore...
i got it replaced with another g2 and the same thing happened to that phone about 3 months in
so i moved on.
it's sad because i really loved that phone
yeah i'm so glad to see android manufacturers supporting their devices longer now.
it's a great time to be an android user.
"lol see what i mean, it's the little things that the pixel phones do that i truly appreciate."
they are so convenient.
it truly feels like a real assistant.
"so when i upgraded from my beloved pixel 2xl to my current pixel 7, i originally wanted to go with the 7 pro, but i decided to go with the regular 7 because of the curved display on the 7 pro."
i'm glad google has done away with them the last two years.
"when i upgrade this time, i'm going with pro xl model, because i want a bigger display this time around."
same my other 2 favorites are the 8 plus and 15 plus.
i never had an iphone but i've always wanted to have one as a secondary device just to play around with.
my wife has the iphone 13 and i have the pixel 7.
"the only apple devices i've ever owned were the original ipod touch and my current ipad 10th gen which i only use for streaming videos, playing casual games, and the occasional zoom calls."
that's good to hear glad it's been great.
all google needs to do is focus more on the power and efficiency of their tensor chips moving forward and they would be the best phones on the market in my humble opinion.
i'm glad they are finally ditching samsung and going with tsmc for the upcoming tensor g5 chips.
"i'm hoping this brings improvement in efficiency, i'm honestly not expecting a huge boost in power though."
that's good to know what do you have now
no i totally get it
i'm a smartphone nerd
so i follow the entire industry.
i have a preference of course
but i acknowledge what each brand brings to the table.
i try to be objective with their strengths and weaknesses.
that's a very fair point.
thank you for sharing this is always a fun conversation.
no problem thank you for sharing your thoughts
those are all fair points my very last samsung device was the galaxy s6
but this was before the one ui days.
samsung has come a loooong way since the touchwiz era.
"to my knowledge only huawei phones were officially banned here in the us, but as far as oppo, vivo, honor, and xiaomi, those companies just never sold phones here."
i completely understand.
"thank you for sharing your thoughts on this, my friend."
i completely agree with you on this.
my personal preference is google because i like their software approach.
i only wish they stepped it up a bit with their hardware.
"that being said, i never had a single issue with any of the two pixel phones i've owned so far."
my beloved pixel 2xl was my first google phone and the one that made me a fan.
i had it for 5 years and it remained flawless performance wise the whole time i had it.
i have had my pixel 7 since launch and the same story.
still rocking along pretty well almost 3 years later.
"i like how the software remains stable, smooth, and well optimized for years."
man that doesn't sound fun.
i personally prefer pixel phones due to the software.
i just wish google stepped it up a bit when it comes to their hardware.
i hear great things about them.
i want them.
if the pixel phones didn't exist oneplus would be my first choice followed closely by the samsung galaxy s series phones.
i like what oneplus is doing with their hardware.
did you get your 7 pro at launch i really wanted to go with the 7 pro when it was time for me to upgrade
but i want with the regular 7 due to the 7 pro having a curved display.
i do plan to upgrade next year to the 11 pro xl because i want a bigger display this time around.
that's totally understandable.
nfc is definitely a must these days.
that's totally fair.
thank you for sharing your thoughts on this.
1520 was the best windows phone i ever had and then the 930 for its compact size.
"yeah, around when android 12 builds were released is when i think they ""merged"" them."
that's when oneplus went down the drain.
in my mind the 7 pro was really the last phone that personified the original oneplus vision- top tier hardware at a budget price with some nice customizations on android.
that's definitely legitimate.
i'm a pixel fanboy but i'm also an objective one.
"i know google hasn't done the best with their hardware over the years, though it is getting better, they still have some ways to go."
i personally haven't had any issues with either my beloved 2xl or my current 7
"but i know many have, especially when it comes to the chipset and the modem."
google really needs to focus more on their hardware.
"i personally think their software is the best in the business it terms of fluidity and optimization, but their tensor chips need to step it up with the power and efficiency."
i'm glad google is finally going with tsmc for their upcoming tensor g5 chip along with a flagship mediatek modem for the pixel 10 series.
which really excites me as a pixel fan.
"again, i haven't had any issues with overheating on my pixel 7 and performance has been great for me, but i know google can definitely do better with their hardware, no question."
"actually, since i drive a small car, a 2021 mx-5, i still get great fuel economy."
"it wasn't about the soda, it was all about the drive."
and getting away from my mother in law.
although it doesn't keep me from being stupid.
"about a month ago, my r8 was going off and i even saw the cop. 54"
in a 40 plus i forgot to put the insurance card back in the car.
they let me go without a ticket because i have such a perfect record.
"perfect, that was the 61st time i've been stopped for speeding but admittedly, that was mostly in my youth."
"it even included what might have been insulting ""just take it easy, don't want to be showing the kids a bad example""."
all my adult kids drive at it below the speed limit.
"example, it took my adult kids 32 hours to drive from their old house to mine they moved here to be nearer to me."
took me 10 hours less.
950 miles example of the first segment but they drove 32 hours straight
"it was a cool phone it was like a blackberry bold, but windows based."
i really liked it.
"it had 3g which was before the iphone 3g came out if i'm not mistaken, but it absolutely ate its battery."
"but i remember it came with an extended battery in the box, and an extra back cover with a camel hump to fit that bigger battery."
glad it's been rocking along pretty well for you.
i'm looking to upgrade either this year to the pixel 10 pro xl or wait until next year for the pixel 11 series.
the only reason is because of the hardware.
i want to go with a larger display this time around.
plus i want a more efficient chipset and modem.
"i'm watching what google does with the pixel 10 series, i'm really curious to see how a tsmc made tensor g5 chip along with the rumored mediatek modem will perform for the pixel 10 series."
now it's where google's ai literally answers the phone for you and asks what you're calling about and the phone will tell you what their response is and you can choose to keep asking them questions via the google ai to find out more info or you can hang up or answer.
pretty much all spam calls.
just hang up when they hear it and it seems like i don't even get any anymore after a few years of having pixels.
it's like they took me off the list because they know my shit's going to screen them
if you do you won't regret it.
"they're some of the best out there, especially for the price."
even the non-pro and the basic nord series ones are pretty decent.
"no, it's some of the hardware components too."
the device i bought has some network issues and gps problems.
sometimes it doesn't get a signal.
"i once heard about this before i bought my phone, but i didn't quite understand it back then."
now i do.
"the processor alone isn't always enough, specially if you're out of signal in the middle of nowhere."
imo the pixel is perfect if the battery was better.
honestly it's the pixel of ios.
"i keep it so people don't complain about blue or green text, plus all my passwords and auto logins."
"however, i'm slowly moving everything to android lately to move away from ios."
i am not really into the details of technologies but in terms of ux and design it's the best android phone i've ever used in my life.
"specially the size, very handy."
"not right at launch, but not too long after."
i absolutely loved the screen on it.
high refresh rate before that became a standard thing and no camera cutout.
the popup camera was so cool.
"also, i'm apparently in the minority of actually liking the screen curve."
gives a nice tactile edge for the back gesture.
nokias had the absolute best cameras.
can't remember the models i had but they were the verizon models.i still have a few of them in a box somewhere.
the extra battery and the battery hump reminds me of my old motorola droid bionic.
i miss the days when you got more in the box smh.
wow.. that's pretty good.
thanks for the explanation
this is good to know
"thank you for elaborating, my friend."
which phone model do you have
"yeah, i'm a pixel fan"
but i've always called them out for their hardware.
google really needs to continue to step it up with their tensor chips in terms of power and efficiency.
i'm glad they are finally switching to tsmc for the upcoming tensor g5 chip.
"also i hear there are rumors of them switching to mediatek's flagship modem as well, but i'm not sure."
thankfully rcs has solved a lot of the issues apple created when it comes to messaging between ios and android.
i respect apple for their quality but i really don't like them as a company and how they do business.
that's totally understandable.
i'm a bit of a nerd when it comes to smartphones lol it's a hobby of mine.
"but i'm glad you're enjoying it, my friend"
that's totally fair.
"i guess i've always been leery of curved displays due to durability concerns, but to be fair i never had a phone with a curved display"
so i admit i'm not qualified to speak on them.
"i miss when phones had the ability to swap batteries, and add storage expansion with sd cards."
"i remember having a dock that could charge an extra battery for my blackberry, so if your phone was dying you could just swap out with a fully charged battery ready to go and keep it moving instead of needing to stop and wait for the phone to charge."
i am a nerd too friend but not specially smartphones but computers.
"can't say i've ever had a problem, and i don't even use screen protectors."
yes i'm with you on that.
i appreciate what you do
that's good to know
so now i'm kicking myself for not going with the 7 pro lolol
i'm glad to see this much pixi dans here in the comments.
i hope more people come across google phones they are not well known outside us.
here in my country i may be the first and the last user of my phone.
there is not much demand for this phone here.
i actually just pulled it back out the other day and flashed lineageos on it to use it for random stuff around the house.
so much better than the garbage oxygenos 12 release.
"that's what pushed me back to the pixel, but i forgot how much i liked that phone."
yeah me too i'm in the us and rarely see pixels in the wild.
it's increased slightly since the pixel 6 series came out but the us is still dominated by apple and samsung.
it's like most people have no clue about pixel phones here which is frustrating.
i think google doesn't want it phones get used as much as it's other products cuz if it wanted he would...
i think google knows their customers and knows how to keep them happy but doesn't want more of them.
haha i wouldn't put it past them
